From before you were born there was an angel assigned to guard you and protect you. A thousand times he has been there working silently and unseen to defend you. Do you understand that I actually hand crafted and created this supernatural being with just you in mind? In My earth walk when I went to the cross I chose not to call upon angelic protection. I could have been delivered from the tree had I only summoned the angel warriors. I chose not to. I refused to call upon them so I could make provision for them to come to your aid. Know this that the angels are working in your behalf today. The threats and pressures of the enemy are being thwarted. The strategies of hell that seem so effective at times are being dealt with by angelic warriors in your behalf. Expect a reversal and a return of My blessing in your life in a great way.

(414, 157, 243, 'Nelson', 'Once again, thank you Father, for the gift of being young. It''s a sheer blessing! So is it wrong to date?! The gazillion dollar question. I usually answer this question this way, and just for the record, if you cannot answer this question or at least give a biblical account on it, you''re not yet relevant to the youth! So many young people may feel that way... But my perspective is this, I say to them, "dating is wrong, because of the premature and unnecessary responsibilities it comes with; at least as far as marriage is concerned, and you''re not married in this instance right." However, dating is not wrong, say if maybe it''s in terms of long-term commitments and has a futurist approach in the dealing and handling of it; then it becomes sort of "justified" that you''re doing a wise thing and you''re not playing nor wasting time (and resources) at the same time right. In this way, we would then call it I believe ''courtship''; an arrangement between a couple to commit to an engagement in marriage, in the future -- which they have to find purpose from God about that. But, again, going back to scripture, we can never over-emphasise the necessity the child of God must see in living an upright life with God and you can name it: staying pure (or abstaining), laying off the sins of fornication and other pre-marital sins. Young people must also understand it is "unlawful" to solicit or have a girl (or lady) or guy (or gentleman) as though they are theirs, before getting married; because they''ll actually be STEALING another man''s property - the father''s property. Because the lady is not yet married to the gentleman, for instance. And another thing is that they should actually share their vision, if they are in a relationship already, which is not so easy and not a child''s play... they will progress that way! They must very clear and express onset that they have intentions of getting married, and if not, drop it like it''s hot, until the phase of marriage, if they so wish to marry, because besides, THERE''S NO ''COHABITATION''!', '566,562,562,63', '2012-08-03 03:34:17'),

I love your passion man. I love your vision and I can easily tell that it''s a God givenn vision. Nelson, I think we should have teams of Christians who go around visiting different schools in their communities and preaching the Gospel in those schools. These teams must preach the Gospel through drama, dance, singing, performances, etc. I believe that when it comes to soul winning we don''t have to be stereotyped, whatever method we have for spreading the gospel should be applied. Business: We should have Business Seminars in different churches in our communities. In these Seminars, we should invite all people (saved or not) to come and get more teachings and advices related to the business world. Even if we don''t invite expensive speakers, we just arrange a few powerful business speakers we know, some maybe from the very same churches. Once we can get people to attend these Business Seminars, at the end of the session we then make an alter call for those who want to accept Christ in their lives. Who should also have teams visiting jails, prisons, hospitals, etc. I believe if the government can be aware of the impact the Bodey of Christ has, they can then give the Church a more favourable consideration.
