Ecclesiates 11:6 "In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good". This scripture is a revelation by which a giver lives.

That''s because the Word has a ministry in your life. Your promotion, success, success, health, increase and greatness are all in the Word. That''s why Paul, writing to Timothy in 1Timothy 4:15 admonished him to give himself wholly-completely-to the ministry of the Word: "Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all". You ought to do the same. Yield yourself to the Word. Let the Word have power in your life.', 'Dear Father, your Word is a lamp unto my path, to guide me in the way that I should go.

It refers to your rest in God; it''s our place in God, where you no longer toil, struggle and sweat for anything in life; you cease from all struggles. This is the life of rest Jesus has brought you into. Remember, He came and paid the price for your sins. He died, was buried and then raised back to life for your justification. Everything about your salvation was consummated in Him, who is today seated at the right hand of the Majesty on high.

It''s now possible for God to be at home in your heart and set up His headquarters in you! What a great blessing this is! God wants the whole world to know they can have the Kingdom of God set up in their hearts. No wonder He says in Ecclesiastes 3:11 that He has set eternity in the hearts of men. The Kingdom is in your heart, and you operate in it by functioning according to God''s Word.', 'Dear Father, thank you for entrusting me with the Gospel of the Kingdom, and for settling up eternity in my heart!

There was a territorial principality that was worshipped by the people of Ephesus named Diana of the Ephesians (also known by her Greek name, Artemis). The people gave money to this false god and it strongly influenced the economy because of this. The city was also the center for magic and the occult.\r\n\r\nHer temple in Ephesus was listed as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World – the most outstanding and opulent example of architecture in the whole city. Her followers called her “magnificent,” “great goddess,” “savior,” and “Queen of Heaven.”\r\n\r\nPaul preached in Asia for two years and had great success confronting this territorial principality. Paul began to neutralize the Queen of Heaven’s power so much by the gospel that the common people began to notice. They not only stopped worshipping and sacrificing to her, the silversmith’s who were manufacturing idols were going out of business, so they staged a public riot. They filled the huge amphitheater and shouted for two hours, “Great is Diana of the Ephesians” (Acts 19:34).\r\n\r\nMany who were converted burned all of the idols and magic books. “When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power” (Acts 19:20). Based on the U.S. economy today, the pile of magic paraphernalia that was burned would have been worth four million dollars!*\r\n\r\nIn order for you to impact your city you must identify and break down the ruling principalities that may be hindering the gospel there.

I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. 8 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, [thou] unclean spirit. 9 And he asked him, What [is] thy name? And he answered, saying, My name [is] Legion: for we are many. 10 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. 11 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. 12 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. 13 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea. 14 And they that fed the swine fled, and told [it] in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done. 15 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. 16 And they that saw [it] told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and [also] concerning the swine. 17 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts. 18 And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him. 19 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee. 20 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all [men] did marvel.', 'KING JAMES', 'ARE YOU LIVING IN THE GRAVEYARD?\r\nI know this question may sound strange to many and funny to some and annoying to others. No one believes they can live in a graveyard while they are in their right mind. Many intelligent clever folks might think it’s crazy to ask such a question. My bishop Rev. Dr. Darlingston G. Johnson defined graveyard as a “MONUMENT of the past.” Let’s take for instance a statue. A statue is a monument of the past. Whenever you see a statue, it does not tell you anything in the present, it tells you about the past.\r\nWith that definition from my bishop in mind, the question above no doubt is a relevant one. It certainly show in clear ways that people are living in graveyards and yet don’t know. What you see in the graveyard is nothing but the past. If you want to remember someone who 40 or more years ago, the graveyard will be the ideal place to remember that person.\r\nIn Isaiah 43:18 it says “Remember not the former things; neither consider the things of old.” This text also supports the fact that there are people who are living in graveyards. Again remember the definition from my bishop; it’s a monument of the past.\r\nDo you know a man or a woman can be driving a nice car; wear nice clothes, and yet be living in a graveyard? I guess someone may now be asking how that is possible. Please keep in mind our definition from my bishop.\r\nIn Mark 5:1-20 there is man called Legion. He lived in the graveyard physically, that was his residential address. Today like legion many are living in the graveyard but in a different way. For Legion he lived there physically, but for many today they are living there mentally and spiritually.\r\nFew ways that shows a person lives in the graveyard:\r\nIf you are still holding something against someone who hurt you in the past, you are living in the graveyard\r\nIf you are still upset with folks who didn’t support you yesterday, you are living in the graveyard\r\nIf you are still angry with your parents because they were not there for you when you were growing up, you are living in the graveyard\r\nIf you are still frustrated and angry over a deal that did not work in the past, you are living in the graveyard\r\nRemember: the graveyard is a MONUMENT of the past.\r\nBut Jesus comes that you will have a changed address. He comes to set you free from the past. He comes to change your story. He comes to give you a future and a hope. It does not matter what you may have gone through or are going through now, Jesus can change any story and give hope.\r\nIn Isaiah 43: 18-19 tells us that there is no need to live in the graveyard. You ask why? God say he is doing something new that do not have any resemblance of the past. He’s doing something NEW with no graveyard address or connection.\r\nToday is your day and now is the time.', 'LORD HELP ME THAT WILL NOT FOCUS ON THE PAST AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING IN THE NOW.', '2012-03-31 06:23:52'),

Paul made it clear here that all we need in life is true and genuine transformation.  It remains to be also true that real transformation comes with a renewed mind.\r\nIn the book of Proverb 23:7, it says that as a man thinketh so is he. The mind plays a very important role as to who we become or what we become etc. whether you are a success or a failure starts from the mind. Transformation is different from Reformation. The first is an internal change and the second is an external change. In other words Transformation deals with the inside where as Reformation deals with the outside. Real change starts from inside out.\r\nMany people are held captive by their thoughts. God did not create you to be poor, but your mind tells you because your parents were poor so you too will remain and die poor. The mind is the battlefield of our spiritual warfare. As you long as you can conquer it in the mind you can conquer it everywhere.\r\nSo when Paul says be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, he was simply saying change your thinking. Changing your thinking is so vital to becoming what God created you to be. This is what will happen when you change your thinking:\r\nWhen you change your thinking, your belief will change;\r\nWhen your beliefs change, your expectations will change;\r\nWhen your expectations change, your attitude will change;\r\nWhen your attitudes change, your behavior will change; \r\nWhen you behavior change, your results will change\r\nWhen your results change, your life eventually will change.\r\nSo it is an issue of the mind. Change the way you see yourself. Change the way you talk. Change the way respond to situations.

About a mile away from the city at the foot of the Mount of Olives, He sent two disciples ahead to the village of Bethphage with specific instructions to look for a donkey tied by a house, with its unbroken colt next to it. Jesus told the disciples to tell the owners of the animal that "The Lord has need of it." \r\nThe men found the donkey just as Jesus said and brought it and its colt to him. Jesus sat on the young donkey and slowly, humbly, made his triumphal entry into Jerusalem.  People threw their cloaks on the ground and put palm branches on the road before him, while others waved palm branches in the air.\r\nThe donkey has been tied there I believed for a good period of time. No one took notice of the donkey for it had been tied. The fact that donkey was tied meant that it was limited in terms of movement. Like the donkey there are many who are tied down by circumstances in life and no one seems to notice them, limited by these circumstances that have tied them. And Jesus sends his disciples to lose this donkey and bring it to him.\r\nThe people put cloaks and palm branches in the path. Notice it was not Jesus walking on the palm branches, but rather the donkey. What if the donkey would have thought that the people were shouting for it? No the shouting was not for the donkey. Isn’t it funny how when things start happening for some people and jubilation and shouts arises they begin to think it’s about them? The shout certainly was not for the donkey but Jesus. When God begin to done great things in our lives and jubilation and shouting arises, let us remember it not about us, it’s about God.\r\nThe donkey understood that it was only a donkey doing what it was loosen to do, take the master into Jerusalem. The donkey that had been tied for so long, that no one took notice of suddenly gains the notice of many. When we do what we have been lose to do and called to do though we might not have been notice, suddenly many will begin to notice us. Naturally no one would have put cloaks and palm branches in the path of a donkey, but because the donkey was with Jesus and doing what it was lose to do.\r\nThe donkey understood its mission and wanted to be nothing else but a conveyer, a medium of transport to take the master into the final end of his sacrificial journey. Like the donkey, I don’t want to be anything else but a donkey that the master will use for his glory and honor. Like the donkey don’t  lose your identity, be what you are and do what you’ve lose to do.\r\n\r\nHere are some important points that we need to know from this Palm Sunday Story:\r\n• When Jesus told the disciples to get the donkey, He referred to himself as ''The Lord,'' a definite proclamation of his divinity.\r\n• By riding into Jerusalem on the colt of a donkey, Jesus fulfilled an ancient prophecy in Zechariah 9:9: "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; righteous and having salvation is he, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." This was the only instance in the Gospels in which Jesus rode an animal.\r\n• Throwing cloaks in the path of someone was an act of homage and submission. The people were recognizing Jesus as the promised Messiah.\r\n• The people''s cries of ''Hosanna'' came from Psalm 118:25-26. Hosanna means "save now." Despite what Jesus had foretold about his mission, the people were looking for a military Messiah who would overthrow the Romans and restore Israel''s independence.\r\nThe crowds refused to see Jesus as he truly was; rather they were placing their personal desires on him instead. \r\nMy question to you this Palm Sunday is: Who is Jesus to you? Is he someone whom you want to satisfy your selfish wants and goals, or is he Lord and Master who gave up his life to save you from your sins?', 'Lord help us to realized our purpose in life and know that it''s all about you', '2012-04-01 14:51:20');

The reason why Jesus died  in this way was to make us the righteousness of God, So now when God looks at us, He sees us being Holy as Christ is Holy. We have been made righteous by faith in Christ Jesus, this means that Jesus is not more righteous than us, instead we are righteous like Him, therefore God answers our prayers not because we are perfect, but because of what Christ Jesus has done for us at the cross, we are not righteous because we did something or because we qualified for it, we are righteous because Jesus died as sin on our behalf.

As I continued in studying God''s Word and also meditating on His Word, I received this revelation that I am a spirit and that God is also Spirit. It''s simple, the only person who can lead soldiers is a person who is in that same field, the only person who can lead doctors can only be a person who is in that field of medicine; We cannot expect a doctor to lead soldiers, and we also cannot expect a soldier to lead doctors. Anyone can only lead people who are within his/her parameters. In the same way, God can only led those who are in the Spirit, that is why He even calls them His Sons. The bible says in the same book of Romans 1:1, "there is now no condemnation to those who are in Christ, WHO DO NOT WALK ACCORDING TO THE FLESH, BUT ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT. You see, a person who is in the flesh or lives according to the flesh, is outside the borders of God, that person cannot walk in the ways of God, that person cannot please God, because he is not within God''s Kingdom. Walking in the Spirit is God''s desire for all His children. What exactly is walking in the Spirit? It is abiding in God''s Word and staying in the meditation of His Word. Walking in the Spirit is allowing your heart to be dominated by God''s Word; This can only happen if you continue to study the Word and continue to meditate on the Word. You don''t have to apply your own efforts in order to remain in the Spirit, you only need to stay in God''s Word; the Word will automatically change you; And in that way, God will led you in everyday of your life, you will know what to do and when to do it, you will know what to say and when to say it, you will know the places you need to go to and the places you mustn''t go to.

For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in [her] body that she was healed of that plague. And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, who touched my clothes?  And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, who touched me?  And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.  And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.', 'KING JAMES', 'Life can be challenging and many times to an extent where it becomes unbearable. Life has a way of taking you from high to low, happy to sad, strong to weak and from have to have not.\r\nOur text above speaks of a woman, with no name only described as “a certain woman.” This woman was experiencing the sting of life in her own life, to an extent I am sure she had never imagined.\r\nShe is infected with an issue of blood for twelve (12) years. This means for over eleven years, she had to deal with this painful, shameful and disgraceful situation.\r\nBy this time all her friends and perhaps some family members left her. For more than eleven years she sought for solution to her situation but to no avail. The bible says she visited all the doctors in town, yet without any positive result.\r\nThe fact that she could visit all the doctors in town suggests that she was well to do financially. One thing that we need to know is that life can hand you stuff that money, fame, prestige or connections cannot solve.\r\nThe bible tells us that one day, perhaps while she was in her hiding place she heard some by-passers who came from one Jesus’ regular miracle meetings talking about what he Jesus had done and the great miracles that took place that day.\r\nWhat great news for this victim of life’s circumstances. The bible did not say she had seen Jesus before, it says she heard about him. She developed a “historical faith.” Permit me to expose four major points gathered from this story about this un-named woman.\r\n1.    The first point gathered here is that this was a woman of Endurance. When life hands you stuff you got no control over no matter how humanly you try, all you need to do is endure. Endurance puts you in the position of expectation. When you endure, you expect your situation to change even though you might not know when or how, but you are sure it will.\r\n2.    The second point is that this was a woman of patience. In the face of all the scorn a laughter she was faced with, she knew there was solution somewhere, and was prepared to wait, to be patient until it show up. She stepped into Job shoes when Job said “I will wait until my change comes.”\r\n3.    The third point is that she was a woman of Faith. Her endurance kept her in expectation, her patience kept her focus on the expected change, but her faith put everything into motion. She said to herself if but I can touch the helm of his garment. She braved all the odds and move forward. Faith will cause you to ignore all impossibilities and energize you to step over walls to receive what God has for you.\r\nI guess her neighbors were surprise to see her leaving her hiding place and they might have probably been wondering where she going. Some maybe thought she was moving out of the community. Notice when she was healed, Jesus told her exactly what made her healed. He said your FAITH has healed thee.\r\n4.    Finally she was a woman of persistency. You might think that she was going to find Jesus free and touch him without difficulty no it was not the case.\r\nAnd if a woman has an issue, [and] her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the evening. (Lev. 15: 19)\r\nAs stated in the text above she had some odds against. First she was unclean to be in the midst and secondly she was a woman coming to where there were predominantly men.\r\nHer persistency to take hold of the helm of his garment, kept her resisting any attempt to stop her from doing so. It was her persistency that brought her desire change and healing. She  knew for sure that “IT WAS TIME” for her to be set free and was prepared to persist and resist until she got what she has long waited for the past eleven and a half years.\r\nIf you will overcome the obstacles that life throws your way, you must be a man or woman of Endurance, Patience, Faith and Persistency. Know it''s your time.', 'Lord teach us to be people of endurance, patience, faith and persistency.', '2012-04-13 05:47:02'),

You don''t have to apply your own strategies in order to be Joyful, True joy is found in God; This is the kind of Joy which is not even affected by life circumstances, This is because that Joy gets rooted deep into your Spirit, and the devil cannot even touch it!

(46, '', 16, 'DEALING WITH THE UNEXPECTED', 'Matthew 13:24', 'Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 28  He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn', 'KING JAMES', 'The Kingdom of God is like a garden. It operates by seed, which is the Kingdom principle.\r\n\r\nThe text is about a man who sowed seed, yes he did but then something happened.\r\n\r\nThe Bible says while men slept, the enemy came and planted tares among his wheat. Notice it did not happen while they were awake. It says while they slept. The enemy will never do a thing to the child of God who is awake and alert.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enemy always has plans for the child of God, evil plans that is. See it says here but when the blade was sprung up, and it brought forth fruit; something happened- then appear the tares also (vs.26). The plan of the enemy was for the tare to also appear with the wheat. They expected fruit and they got it. What they did not expect was the tare.\r\n\r\nWhen things are turning the way you expected, then the unexpected comes. When the best moments of your life come out, there is a tendency for the unexpected to come out. The enemy planted the tares among the wheat so that they could come up together\r\n\r\nThere are things you can cause in your life by what you sow but there also things that the enemy can cause in your life. In this case they got what they sowed. Whatever you put in the ground is what you will take out. Remember you will reap what you sowed. If you want love sow love\r\n\r\nWhatever you sow is what you reap. Put time into your business, family etc, you will reap what you put in.\r\n\r\nWhen you pray you ask God for a harvest, but He will give you a seed because the Kingdom operates by seed. The Bible says as long as the earth remains there will seed time and harvest time, sowing time and reaping time.\r\n\r\nI believe the reason many Christians are not getting harvest is because they do not understand the difference between the seed and the harvest. They use their seed as harvest. It is not the harvest that produces the seed, rather it is the see that produce the harvest. No seed, no harvest.\r\n\r\nNotice it say in (verse 26), but when the blade sprung up (which means they planted their seed), and it brought forth fruit, and then appear the tares also. The tares appear when the blade sprung up. When the unexpected show up in your harvest, know it is your reason. The tares did not show up until the blade did. The blade brings the fruit which means it is your season to harvest. Whenever the unexpected shows up in your life, you need to remind yourself, it is my season. You started a business and thought that all will be fine then something happened. You got married and thought that it all would be great and fine and then something happened. The unexpected will always come.\r\n\r\nWHY will the enemy plant tares among your wheat?\r\nThe enemy will plant tares among your wheat or the enemy will plant things in your life to abort the purpose of God for your life.\r\n\r\nJust when you are about to experience what God has in store for you then the tares show up. The best time and the worst of time all springs up together.\r\n\r\nDidn’t we sow good seed in the field? They tried to make sense out of the situation. They knew they sow good seed, so any thing other then the good seed was not their doing. They were certain that they sow good seeds.\r\n\r\nThere are some things that happen in your life that does not make sense, but God want to use it for His glory\r\n\r\nThe man born blind- the disciples tried to make sense of it by asking whose sin was he born blind, and Jesus replied… so that glory of God would be reveal.\r\n\r\nYou will never know the integrity of what God has place inside you until there are opposition\r\n\r\nThey wanted to undo what they did not do. Will thou then that we go and gather them up? Notice they wanted to pluck up the tares immediately. Immediately!!!!!!\r\n\r\nWatch out for quick fixes on the unexpected. Quick fixes can increase damage. Like they say in Liberia, quick, quick burst trousers. Stand still and compose yourself\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice the master’s reply to the request to go and pull the tares up. He said to them “leave it alone.”  They wanted to do a quick fixing but the master said no, leave it alone. There is a time for everything under the sun (Eccl. 3:1).  The master said when the time is right I will cut it off.\r\n\r\nYou need to understand that the fight is God’s fight. Hold you peace and let the Lord fight your battle. Time is very important in the kingdom of God. Watch out for doing the right thing at the wrong time.\r\n\r\nMoses was a deliverer but had wrong timing when he starting fighting and killing. God had to send him to the back side of the desert to learn real leadership. If he could deal with real sheep, as stubborn as they are, surely he could lead the sheep of God.\r\n  \r\nMany times when people are in a situation they pray that God deliver them from it, but the truth is that God want to deliver them through it.\r\n\r\nWhen you come into your season, you come into it with the problem but your season isn’t over yet. It was their time to harvest but they came into their season with a problem.\r\n\r\nIf you will deal with the unexpected you must compose yourself, so that you can make one radical decision that is not control by your emotion. A godly decision not control by your emotion.\r\n \r\nHalleluiah!!!!!!!!!!', 'Lord help us to compose ourselves in the midst of an unexpected situation so that can make a godly decision that is not influence by our flesh', '2012-04-14 11:42:36'),

Staying in union with the risen Savior gives you the courage and strength need to live for him. When you stay in union with the risen Savior, you find meaning for living. Many are struggling to the Christian life all because they are doing it apart from him-the risen Savior.\r\nOur text is about ten virgins. Interestingly five were wise and five foolish. Being wise is remembered to do what is important or what you ought to do and doing it. Five were wise and remembered what to do, the other five were foolish for they could not remember what to do, and they had no vision so to speak. They did not foresee the future. When you stay in union with the risen Savior you are assured of the future. \r\nHow can you keep your lamp full? You can keep your lamp full   by remembering:\r\n1. Life in Jesus is hard when you load your heart and mind with burdens you were not meant to carry. When you let yourself carry unassigned burdens, His will is misunderstood. You begin to think He is not fair or that you have to measure up to the task. Soon you begin to think the task is too hard to do. Some blame it on a non-existent demon, wondering why he doesn''t obey the name of Jesus. Carrying a burden you were never meant to carry can turn into bondage (Galatians 5:1). The devil wants you to think serving Jesus is impossible. Serving Jesus is meant to be a joy. Yes, there are demons, but they are not meant to run your life, Jesus is. Take the authority Jesus has given you and walk in freedom (Luke 10:19)!\r\n2. Life in Jesus is hard when you carry any burden except the one He has for you. Here are three types of burdens: \r\na) Yours (Galatians 6:5); \r\nb) Others that are assigned to you – help each other when it is in your power to do so (Galatians 6:2);\r\n c) And Christ''s (Matthew 11:28-30). We must stay in union with Him and "learn of Him." Many saints started out serving Him with great energy and sincere commitment, but having familiarity rather than intimacy with Jesus, they wound up frustrated, discouraged and confused. God''s rest eludes them.\r\n3. Life in Jesus is easy when you know you have but one responsibility: Staying in union with Him, abiding in Him (John 15:4). Unless we are in union with Him, we cannot keep the commandments. We will not have the strength. Besides, everything we do outside of Him will produce things that add up to nothing. Nothing means zero, blank, you lose, unproductive, no lasting fruit.\r\n4. Life in Jesus is easy when you realize His commandments are not grievous (I John 5:3). Jesus will never give you more than you can bear, temptation-wise (I Corinthians 10:13) and burden-wise (Numbers 11:11-17). Life is easy when you realize His grace is always sufficient (2 Corinthians 12:9) for each day.\r\n5. Life in Jesus is easy when we recognize that He can appear in a vast array of disguises, ready to become visible in any circumstance or through any vessel. Jesus can be mistaken for a gardener (John 20:15) or a stranger (Luke 24:16). When we are in union with the Master, we will be amazed at how He will suddenly manifest Himself to us. The Lord will sometimes speak through the most unlikely vessels, like you and me.\r\nWhen Jesus died on that Cross, He made something available to you and me...the ability to rest in the midst of chaos.\r\nMany years ago, a little boy was given a priceless possession: his deceased grandfather''s gold pocket watch. How he treasured it! But one day, while playing at his father''s ice plant, he lost the watch amid all the ice and sawdust. He searched, becoming frantic, but no watch. Then he suddenly realized what to do. He stopped scurrying around and became very still. In the silence, he heard the watch ticking.\r\nGod has given each of us the priceless gift of resting in Him. How easy it is to lose His rest in the business of our life. Yet, it is always there to find, if we will but pause and listen to the presence of Jesus in our hearts.\r\nToday rest in Him. Lay that burden down at His feet. He is waiting to lift it off of you. The spirit of heaviness is about to be lifted off of many (Isaiah 61:3). Go to Him today and: \r\nStay in union with Jesus...if you do this one thing, everything else will fall into place.', 'Lord help that we will keep our lamps full', '2012-04-15 14:26:34'),

I hear a big YES!!! Then there is no condemnation for you, says the Word of God. Bear in mind, the Word says "there is no condemnation to those in Christ, who do not walk according to the FLESH but according to the SPIRIT!" This means that it is possible to be in Christ and still walk in the flesh; But the part for no condemnation applies only for those who are in Christ and also walk according to the SPIRIT. What does it mean when a person is in Christ and walks according to the flesh? It means this person is now born-again, this person is a new creation, this person has accepted Christ in his/her heart, BUT this person still desires the things of the world, this person still speaks and behaves like the world, this person is still subject to his/her fleshly desires, this person still loves the things of the world; A person like this is a person who is in Christ, but walks according to the flesh! The bible teaches us that God is Spirit, and now that we are in Him, we should walk in the Spirit and according to the Spirit. Now that we are in Christ, we should desire the things of the Spirit, because the flesh does not please God, In-fact you cannot please God in the flesh. So, if you''re born-again and still walk according to the flesh, then you are heading towards condemnation; But when you are born-again and walk according to the Spirit, then there is NO condemnation for you. The bible says in the same book of Romans 8:6, "To be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace." You See Now!

You see! The power which God uses to do mighty things in our lives, is the power which is already at work in us. So, don''t limit God, because in you there is power which God can use to do great and mighty things; So when you limit Him, you are actually preventing Him from accessing that power which is already in you. One of the things which the devil can use in order to cause you to limit God is ''fear''. The bible says in 2 Timothy 1:7, "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind". Fear can cause you to limit God; It can cause you to draw back from doing the great things which God has anointed you to do.

According to God''s Word, God does not want us to live ordinary lives; We should never limit Him, because He has invested so much power in us. Therefore, we ought to live extra ordinary lives, we ought to do great and mighty things, we ought to function in great power; What is impossible to others should be possible to us because of the great power which God has already imparted into us. Where the world fails, we ought to succeed, for we are born of God.

For many years I thought that waiting on God means stopping to do a certain thing and then praying until God says you can do it! That is so wrong guys! That is not what it means to wait on God. Bear in mind, according to God''s Word, God is more eager to bless you that you are eager to receive. God is so much desirous to see  you enjoying the fullness of your inheritance. So, why would He cause you to wait or to stop in doing something! God will not stop you or cause you to wait when you want to do something great for Him. So what exactly does it means to wait on God? It means to ''TRUST'' in God! It means ''NOT TAKING MATTERS INTO YOUR OWN HANDS'', it does not mean ''stopping''. Let''s say for example there''s a big project you want to commence and you don''t have enough money at the starting point of the project; Then waiting on God would mean that you begin the project and then trust in God for the rest of the finances to complete the project, without being unfaithful in obtaining the finances! Waiting on God should never be an expression of laziness or the fear of beginning; Because many people are actually afraid of beginning, therefore they say they are waiting on God; Others are lazy to work, therefore they say they are waiting on God! Dear friend, waiting on God means trusting in God for everything; Waiting on the Lord means not depending on your own strategies and plans, as the bible says in Proverbs 3:5 "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding". This is what it means to wait on God. So Kt, can I do anything at any time and trust God for it??? NO! There is something called ''the wisdom of waiting'', but that''s a subject for another day!

What is amazing about this is that fighting (fighting with someone) is something which is totally wrong before the Lord, yet God tells us to fight the good fight of faith! Why does God refer to this fight as good? There are two reasons why God refers to this fight as ''good''. Number 1: in this fight you are not fighting with anyone! LOL!!! Isn''t that ironic? You are in a fight but you are not fighting against anyone. YES, it''s true, in this fight you are not fighting anyone. Many Christians think that God says we should fight a good fight of faith against the devil. NO! We are not fighting with the devil; The devil has been totally defeated, Colossians 2:15 makes us aware that Jesus disarmed the kingdom of darkness and made a public spectacle of them, So there is no way we can still be fighting the devil because the devil has been TOTALLY defeated. Always keep it in mind that when God talks about us fighting a good fight of faith, He doesn''t mean that we should fight with the devil, NO! The devil has been defeated, he has been disarmed, he is now left with NOTHING but a BIG mouth which is full of lies. Number 2: in this fight, the results/outcome is guaranteed from the very beginning. WOW! So the fight is predictable??? YES! You can easily tell the outcome of the fight. So, What exactly is a good fight of faith??? Fighting a good fight of faith means ''keeping what you have already received!'' It means ''protecting what already belongs to you!'' As God''s Sons and Daughters, our battle is not to take, it is to keep! Remember, at the cross Jesus said these words ''it is finished'', and again remember the Word says we are ''joint heirs'' with Christ, meaning that whatever belongs to Christ also belong to us, and whatever has been given to Christ by the Father also was given to us! So the good fight of faith is standing in faith to keep and protect my inheritance as a Son or Daughter of God! It has got nothing to do with the devil. What I have to do is to abide in God''s Word (John 8:31) so that I don''t lose my identity in Christ; then be able to keep what is already mine! Child of God, stay in the Word, stay in meditation of God''s Word, stay in prayer, stay in Love, This is what it really is to fight a good fight of faith!

It bothers you so much that it moves you to action.

When she hears what Mordecai is doing, it deeply disturbes her. She probably thinks that a lot of people will die unless she does something.

Speaking in tongues is something which each and every believer must do. If you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and have accepted His Lordship in your life, you must pray in tongues! Therefore, speaking in tongues is not a gift, it''s a believer''s portion. It is very important as a child of God to pray in tongues; What are tongues? Tongues are the mysterious language of the Spirit; This is a language of the Spirit which can only be understood by God and all those to whom the Holy Spirit interprets it. Praying in tongues is something which every born-again believer must do; Even if you don''t understand what you are saying, you must continue in the lifestyle of praying in tongues. The bible is clear that when we pray in tongues, it is our spirits praying and our minds are unfruitful (1Cor 14:14); So you don''t necessarily have to understand what you are saying, you just have to allow your spirit to pray in tongues, because praying in tongues is your portion as a believer of Jesus Christ! Just open up your mouth and begin to pray in the spirit, you do not need anyone to teach you how to speak in tongues; already you have the ability to speak in tongues because you believe in the Lord Jesus; So, according to God''s Word, the qualification for speaking in tongues is only believing in the Lordship of Jesus Christ and accepting His Lordship in your life. If you have accepted Christ in your life, then you don''t need a Pastor to come and lay hands on you before you can speak in tongues, Just open up your mouth and begin to speak in tongues by faith! Do it by faith! Remember the Word of God says that it is impossible to please God without faith (Hebrews 11:6), so open up your mouth by faith and begin to speak in tongues; You don''t have to understand what you are saying, Just speak in tongues by faith, allow your spirit to say mysteries to God, DO IT BY FAITH!!! You may be asking yourself: What happens when I pray in tongues? This is what happens: Tongues put your in a better position for hearing God. When you live a lifestyle of praying in tongues, it becomes so EASY to hear God. God is always talking to us, but for some Christians it is so much difficult to hear Him, this is because of their spiritual positioning, So when you pray in tongues, you come to a better position of hearing God! Tongues also cause God to act on your behalf! By just praying in tongues, the life of your cousin can be saved. By just praying in tongues, your child can be prevented from being in an accident, your house can be protected from burglary, and many more things! Tongues empower you, they energize you in the spirit.

When God told Israel to be holy in Leviticus 11 and 19, He was instructing them to be distinct from the other nations by giving them specific regulations to govern their lives. Israel is God''s chosen nation and God has set them apart from all other people groups. They are His special people, and consequently they were given standards that God wanted them to live by so the world would know they belonged to Him. When Peter repeats the Lord''s words in 1 Peter 1:16, he is talking specifically to believers. As believers, we need to be "set apart" from the world unto the Lord. We need to be living by God''s standards, not the world''s. God isn''t calling us to be perfect, but to be distinct from the world. First Peter 2:9 describes believers as "a holy nation." It is a fact! We are separated from the world; we need to live out that reality in our day-to-day lives, which Peter tells us how to do in 1 Peter 1:13-16.\r\nFinally, how can we become holy? Holiness only results from a right relationship with God by believing in Jesus Christ as Savior (accepting His gift of eternal life). If we have not placed our faith in God''s Son alone to save us from our sins, then our pursuit of holiness is in vain. So, we must first make sure we are born-again believers (see John 3). If we truly are believers, then we recognize that our position in Christ automatically sets us apart from the world (1 Peter 2:9). After all, we have a relationship with the living God! Then we must daily live a set-apart life, not trying to "blend in" with the world, but instead living according to God''s Word as we study the Bible and grow in it.', 'Lord help us to live a holy life at all times,help us to engrave your word on the table of our hearts so that we do not sin against thee...Amen', '2012-11-13 10:28:26'),

Someone put it this way: ''When you can''t trace His hand, you can trust His heart.'' When the disciples were being tossed like a cork on the waves, Jesus was up on a mountain praying for them! He was aware of the problem and He was working on the solution. He was their mediator and their ''need meet-er'', just as He has one hand on your need and the other on your answer. ''...He always lives to intercede for [you]'' (Hebrews 7:25 NIV). Can you imagine Jesus praying to the Father for His fear-filled disciples?

David no doubt pen this Psalm knowing exactly who a shepherd is. Remember he was also a shepherd to his father Jesse’s sheep. David had a complete insight of the work and duty of a shephered.\r\nAs a shepherd himself to natural sheep he understood well what our heavenly shepherd is to us. David knew the protection, care that he was providing to his father’s sheep and he no doubt knew that the Good Shepherd of our souls was even more than what he was to his father’s sheep.\r\nDavid understood that the sheep depended on him for everything and they needed not to concern themselves with anything as it relates to their daily lives, what they would eat, safety, security, etc.\r\nDavid knew it was all his concern to care for the sheep. When the bear and lion showed up, it was no concern of the sheep, it was the concern of the shepherd. It was David who had to deal with the lion and the bear, for it was his duty to protect them. It is not mentioned anywhere that the sheep helped David to kill the lion and the bear. In David’s testimony to Saul, he “a lion and bear came and I slew them…” nothing is mentioned about the sheep helping.\r\nIn our text above we can clearly see that David for sure knew that God was his shepherd and as he was to his father’s sheep, more so was God the Good Shepherd to him. David knew that God was more than able to take care of everything that concerned him.\r\nDavid claimed, if the Lord is my shepherd I shall not lack or want anything, why? Because like I was to my father’s sheep, more so is he to provide all that I need even beyond.\r\nHere David outlines God’s ability to provide, comfort, heal, protect, guide, care for, be merciful, restore etc. David knew that if he being human could provide for his father’s sheep, God the creator could even do more and greater.\r\nThe question is: Is the Lord your Shepherd?\r\nIt is easy to say, but do you really believe that he is? If you are still trouble and wondering how you can or will make it, then I still want to ask, is the Lord your shepherd?\r\nFor the Lord to be your shepherd is not just by word of mouth, but it must be accompanied by action. What you do or say plays a greater part in knowing whether or not the Lord is your shepherd.\r\nNotice David said, “I shall not want…” in other words, God is the manager of my affairs and he does not need my advice, so I don’t have to worry. If the Lord is your shepherd, then your confession must line up with your actions.\r\n“I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep knows my voice…” (John 10:14). Do you know his voice if he is your shepherd?\r\nFor David he knew that just as his father’s sheep depended on him, more so was he depended on the Lord. It is the shepherd’s duty to concern himself with everything that concerns the sheep. The sheep depended on the shepherd for everything from security to provisions.\r\nAs outlined in our text above, here we see what the Good Shepherd is to us:\r\nHe is the SEEKING Shepherd to the sheep that is lost\r\nHe is the PROVIDING Shepherd to the sheep that is in need\r\nHe is the COMFORTING Shepherd to the sheep that is hurting\r\nHe is the HEALING Shepherd to the sheep that is bruised\r\nHe is the PEACEFUL shepherd to the sheep that is anxious\r\nHe is the GUIDING Shepherd to the wandering sheep\r\nHe is the PROTECTING Shepherd to the sheep that is fearful\r\nHe is the CARRYING Shepherd to the lame sheep\r\nHe is the FULFILLING Shepherd to the to the discounted sheep\r\nHe is the ANOINTING Shepherd to the parched or dried sheep\r\nHe is the REASSURING Shepherd to the sheep that is timid\r\nHe is the MERCIFUL Shepherd to the sheep that has fallen\r\nHe is the QUIETING Shepherd to the sheep that is nervious\r\nHe is the RESTFUL Shepherd to the sheep that is so heavy laden\r\nHe is the EVER-PRESENT Shepherd to the sheep is so lonely\r\nHe is the RESTORING Shepherd to the sheep that is weary\r\nAnd he is the GOOD SHEPHERD to all His sheep.\r\nBrothers and sister truly the Lord is our Shepherd and he can be whatever we want him to be. The choice is ours to accept him as our Shepherd and he will no doubt be to you what you want him to be.\r\nIn my own personal life as a missionary on the mission field, I have seen and continue to see the Lord as my Shepherd and have and continue experience the all of the above in my life and ministry. As the Good Shepherd he has been my help in ages past and he is no doubt my hope for years to come.

He says here, "if we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit." First of all, we see that there is a big difference between living in the Spirit and walking in the Spirit. It is not possible for you to live in South Africa and not walk in South Africa, yet it is possible to live in the Spirit and not walk in the Spirit. Kt, how is this possible? When a person gets born-again, he/she comes into the Spirit, according to 2 Cor 5:17 "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation..." Christ is Spirit, therefore when you accept Him in your heart and make Him the Lord and Saviour of your life, you come into the Spirit, because Christ is Spirit! Now, being in the Spirit is the first step. The second step is walking in the Spirit! There are Christians who have accepted Christ in their hearts, meaning that they are in the Spirit; they go to church and they love God; Yet they do not walk in the Spirit. When I say they do not walk in the Spirit I mean they still do as the world does, during parties they drink beers with others who are not born-again, they still go out in the night to night clubs and taverns (they call it ''grooving''), they are involved in sexual relationships, yet they are born-again and go to church every Sunday. The Apostle Paul had a clear revelation of such Christians, that is why he writes that "if we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit!" Come On! You are now in the Spirit, begin to also walk in the Spirit! Walking in the Spirit means doing according to God''s Word and desiring to grow in the knowledge of Christ and also doing all it takes in order to know Him more. Pray to God the Father, and ask Him in the Name of Jesus to give you the desire to know Him more, ask Him to give you more hunger for Him so that you may find it easy to walk in the Spirit. Peter says in 1 Peter 1:14 "Let us not allow our lives to be shaped by the desires we had when we were still in the dark." Don''t allow old desires control your live now, you are now in the Spirit, you must now walk in the Spirit. Even if it means changing your friends in order to walk in the Spirit, then do it! Because some people cannot walk in the Spirit because of the kind of friends they have, they find it difficult to differ from their friends; Then the solution is to change those friends; You rather have Jesus as your only friend, than to have 1000 friends who will mislead you and swift you away from the Spirit life.

For many years I thought that 1 Cor 2:9 was referring to God''s children: It says, "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man, The things which God has prepared for those who love Him." I used to think that this scripture is referring to us who are born-again; I used to think that God has a surprise for us which He would one day reveal. But today as I meditated on these to verses (1 Cor 2:9-10), I received the revelation that this scripture is not referring to us God''s children. Let''s break it down: 1. "Eye has not seen" - Which eyes have not seen? The eyes of those who are outside of God''s Kingdom (who are not yet born-again and are still under the control of the kingdom of darkness). 2. "Nor ear heard" - Which ears have not heard? It is the ears of those who are not yet in Christ. 3. "Nor have entered into the heart of man" - Which hearts? Same answer: The hearts of those who are not yet in Christ! We are now in Christ, we are now one with God. God lives in us and we live in God. The Holy Spirit is now one with us. So, there is no way we cannot know what God knows. Whatever God knows, we now know because of the Holy Spirit. All that God has done for us, we now know because the Holy Spirit has revealed it to us. All the beautiful things God has done for us, we know them by His Spirit which searches all things, even the deep things of God! Hallelujah!

Nature is not happy with the curse upon it, it eagerly desires to be managed and controlled by Sons of God. According to Romans 8:20, nature did not choose to be under this curse, nature was happy to be under the control of the man God created, because this man was handling it according to God''s purpose; yet nature was condemned, not of its own choice, but because God willed it to be so. BUT, God placed HOPE upon nature, that it would one day be set free from its slavery to decay and would share the glorious freedom of the Sons of God. Children cannot deliver nature from its curse, it is only Sons who can bring this deliverance to nature. The body of Christ is in need of Sons; Men and Women who function exactly like Jesus! Yes, we are born of God and are like Him; But being born of God and functioning like Him are two different things! Sons are those who are like God and also function like Him. Children are like God, but they have not yet tapped into His functionality. Children are those who are always asking for prayers (bear in mind: it''s not wrong to ask for prayers), but Sons can change any situation at anytime. These are the ones which nature is longing for: ''Sons!'' Jesus is the best example of a Son. Nature was under His authority. He spoke to the sea and the sea became calm. This means the sea was so happy at that time to be managed by a ''Son''. The fish in the sea will not swim into a trap, but because of the authority of Jesus, the fish were so happy to run into Peter''s net. This is what nature is longing for: ''Sons!''

Many people think "freedom" is the right to do whatever you want, whenever you want. Anyone who tries to limit their freedom, is seen as an oppressor. Every form of discipline is opposed by intense rebelliousness. True freedom is infinitely more than a political or social aspiration. It is a deep spiritual experience that finds expression in a moral obligation. It is to do what you must do and not what you want to do. It is to become what God has intended you to be and not an image you have conjured up for yourself. You can only be truly free if you accept your responsibilities as a child of God. To consciously evade your responsibilities, is to be incarcerated in a dungeon of which you yourself were the architect. Eventually you are tortured by self-reproach, uncertainty and indecision. Freedom is an attitude of life. When Christ becomes the Lord of your life, you get to know the incomparable joy of having been liberated from the ties of sin. Fear is replaced by faith, hate by love and denigrating attitudes and thoughts make space for the freedom inspired by Jesus Christ. When Jesus controls your life by His Spirit, sin no longer has power over your thoughts and over your deeds, and you are free to serve Him in gratitude and with joy. Then your inheritance becomes a reality to you and you take the Saviour at His Word when He says: "My peace I give unto you..."

The deepest longing of the disciples was to have Jesus with them continuously and permanently. Because He was aware of this sincere desire, He gave them the promise that the Holy Spirit would reveal Him to them in a very special way. It was a glorious promise of grace and it is still valid to every single follower of Jesus Christ today. Everything the Spirit receives from Christ, He will reveal to the children of God: His love, joy, peace - all that is of Him and can be a blessing to us! In the life of committed disciples, the Holy Spirit will continually, hour by hour every day, grant the strengthening presence of Jesus Christ. The Spirit then becomes a means to an end: He helps us to stay in communion with Jesus, get to know Him, love Him and serve Him better. The Holy Spirit does this work in silence, but with dynamic force. Without our noticing it, the fruit of the Spirit will grow in our inner-beings and will be manifested in our lives.

Some people reject it as being impractical because of the demands it poses, because it is completely impossible to live a holy life if your dedication to God is half-hearted.

Without this ability, we will lack the self-confidence to lead a purposeful and joyful life. Obedience doesn''t mean that you have to submit yourself reluctantly to whatsoever God may place across your pathway. It means to accept that God in His great wisdom knows what is best for you, and to live in obedience to His will. Every human being experiences moments of depression that borders on despair. It is precisely for moments like these that God gives us His Holy Spirit to fan the flames of hope in us. If you allow the Holy Spirit to guide you, it will be your deepest desire to do the will of God under all circumstances - even in a Gethsemane of blood and sweat. Initially it might be difficult, but by the power of the Holy Spirit working in you, you will be able to live to the glory of God. It needs courage not to do what you want to do, but to do what God wants you to do. A surprising by-product of obedience to the will of God, is that you gain self-confidence and a stronger faith. That is when you begin to live without fear and a feeling of inferiority. When the Holy Spirit guides you, you develop spiritual courage. Then you will agree with Robert Louis Stevenson who said that "courage is not the absence of fear, but the victory over it."

We must prayerfully take this truth to heart every year God grants us. Christ says the world cannot receive Him because they do not know who He is. "The world" refers to those people who live as though there is no God, people who do not reckon with God when they plan their lives and look upon Him as irrelevant. There is no place for Him in their lives. They are so occupied with worldly things that they have no time or feeling for the things of the Spirit. That is why they became spiritually deaf and blind.

Abraham did that. God promised him children ''...as numerous as the stars...'' (Genesis 22:17 NIV). Tired of waiting, he took matters into his own hands and fathered Ishmael with his wife''s maidservant, Hagar. And that''s when his troubles began in earnest. Now, God loved Ishmael and had great plans for him, but Abraham had to let go of him in order to fulfil God''s will. It was one of the most painful experiences of Abraham''s life. So:1) Refuse to let the enemy send anything into your life that will undermine what you have been waiting and praying for.2) Be careful who you take advice from.

When the Lord promises to make you the head, what it simply means is you will be the most important person around. It also means you will be indispensible. The tail on the other hand is so useless that the Lord did not even bother giving it to man. Inside the head are two eyes. There is a reason for two eyes. Ecclesiastes 4:9 says two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor. If one of the eyes is bad, the other can be used for vision. Another reason is that the second eye can confirm what the first eye has seen .Matthew 18:20 says out of the mouth of two or three the truth shall be established. The head is responsible for vision. According to Proverbs 29:18 where there is no vision, death is imminent.\r\n\r\nAlso in the head are two ears. There is a reason for two ears but I will touch that later. The ears are very important because Romans 10:17 says faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. What the head hears determines what will happen to the body. What the ear hears determines whether the body will be happy or not. As the head what are you hearing? There are many who are well informed when it comes to news and current affairs. They hear what the doctors have to say; they hear what the economist have to forecast; they hear what the news reporters have to report; they even listen to what the experts have to say about their situation but they have not taken time to check what the word of God is saying. Maybe I should take this opportunity to tell you that no matter what you are going through all will be well. How do I know this? Well the word of God says tell the righteous it shall be well with them,Isaiah 3:10. If you are righteous, be rest assured all will be well. What the head hears also determines the future of the body. How does one get a woman to marry him? It is not by looking at her and smiling. It is by saying things into the woman’s ear. What she hears will inform her decision to either agree or disagree to be your wife. To be head means I will hear the word of God that will increase my faith. It also means I will be hearing what God has to say. Revelations 2:7 says he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. Even if what God has to say is a rebuke, as the head you should be ready to hear that. Ecclesiastes 7:5 says it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. There is no one living who has no faults. We see the back of head of everyone; we need people to see the back of our heads too. We see the faults of others; we need others to see our faults too. As leaders we should be ready to listen when been corrected.\r\nKEY WORD: I shall be the head simply means I will I hear the word of God that will increase my faith.

They argue that no one can think God exists and even be convinced that God exists, but at best skeptics argue that belief in God is a blind, illogical leap into the dark. But Christianity, as Paul explained to the Roman governor Festus, is a very reasonable faith. When Festus exclaimed, "You are out of your mind!" Paul replied, "I am not insane....What I am saying is true and reasonable" (Acts 26:25 NIV). It is reasonable because there is evidence. God created humankind and "never left them without evidence of Himself" (Acts 14:17 NLT). What is the evidence? The amazing, complex world around us and the universe above us. As Paul explained, the seasonal water cycles, the fertility of the earth, and the mystery of life itself are not only proof of God''s existence, but also of His loving care. Modern biological sciences - particularly when one descends to the level of microbiology - confirm how breathtaking life is. The fingerprints of God are all over the plethora of earth''s life forms. Their unique, complex, and interdependent designs are evidence that an intelligent designer made them. David also tells us, "The heavens proclaim the glory of God. The skies display his craftsmanship" (Psalm 19:1 NLT). We know the heavens to be far more awesome and astonishing than the ancients could possibly have imagined. Not only are the stars awe-inspiring and beautiful, but the universe - filled with galaxies, nebulae, red dwarfs, planets, moons, and black holes, not to mention the constant array of new discoveries - astounds us.

Neither did He emerge from some other dimension into our present space-time reality. After all, God is the one who created space and time and all the dimensions in the first place. One of God''s titles is "The Eternal God" (Genesis 21:33 NIV). David, inspired by the Holy Spirit, stated, "You are from all eternity" (Psalm 93:2 NIV). The concept of infinity is difficult for our finite minds to grasp. In our experience, all life has both a beginning and an ending. Even the universe itself, as ancient as it is, once had a spectacular inception. But God has neither beginning nor end. He is utterly beyond any frame of reference that we have or can even logically theorize about. We cannot begin to grasp the concept of an all powerful Being who lives for endless ages. We can only say like Job, "How great is God - beyond our understanding! The number of His years is past finding out" (Job 36:26 NIV). In fact, for God to be God, He has to be beyond our understanding. Of which He is! If we could understand Him, we''d be omnipotent (all-knowing) like Him. And of course we are not. He is, as Job said, "a mystery past finding out". Some people ask, "Who made God?" The logical answer is that no one made God. If some other being had made God, then that being would be God.

A miracle by definition, defies the laws of nature. But God is capable of overriding His own existing laws to bring about new results. Take the parting of the Red Sea: the Bible states, "The Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind" (Exodus 14:21 NKJV), and when the Israelites crossed the sea bed, "the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left" (Exodus 14:22 NKJV).

Before your dream comes to pass, you have to see yourself accomplishing that dream. You’ve got to get a picture of it. Before you lose the weight, before you break the addiction, you have to see it happening in your imagination. \r\nToday, instead of thinking about your problems, think about God’s promises. Get a vision for what He has in store for your future. Imagine yourself living in victory. Imagine yourself healed. Imagine yourself walking in abundance. Imagine yourself blessing other people. Just imagine what God has in store for you because nothing is impossible with Him!', 'Father, today I set my heart and mind on You. Give me Your vision for my future.

It connects you to another person when you give in order to make their life better. Jesus said that real love is shown when a person lays down his life for a friend - that''s the ultimate in giving.

Sometimes these people will give you one more chance to get it right, or one more chance to correct the problems. BUT what''s most wonderful is that God never gives up on you. He constantly gives you one more chance. He looks at your heart''s desire and gives you chance after chance to obey more, to love more and to learn more.

He gave sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and even raised the dead back to life. Many Jews had no idea that the Messiah, when He came, would do such things - but the scriptures had clearly foretold that He would (Isaiah 29:18; 35:5-6; 42:7). When John the baptist began questioning whether Jesus was the promised Messiah, Jesus sent this message back with John''s disciples: "Go and tell John the things which you hear and see: the blind see and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up" (Matthew 11:4-5 NKJV). Jesus fully expected that John would understand that these miracles were proof that He was the Messiah. These things (miracles) were part of Jesus'' ministry for two reasons: First, they proved that God had given power to Jesus. When Jesus healed a blind man, His religious enemies cross-examined the man, insisting that Jesus was a sinful, godless person. The formerly blind man wisely replied, "Since the world began it was not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing" (John 9:32-33 KJV). Jesus'' astonishing miracles were proof that He was the Messiah. From the beginning of Jesus'' ministry, "many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did" (John 2:23 KJV). The second reason that Jesus did healing miracles was that He cared for people. In a day when so many were sick and doctors so few and their skills so limited, healing power clearly demonstrated God''s love for them.', 'Dear Jesus, thank you for your love which you have revealed unto us all!', '2012-05-12 04:15:34'),

The Holy Spirit (or the Holy Ghost) is now ever readily available; all one has to do is to receive Jesus Christ as Lord and personal Saviour, and become born-again.

The head simply means the leader, captain; one in charge e.t.c. The head bears a lot of responsibility because inside the head is the brain responsible for making decisions. Inside the head are two eyes. For the head to function properly, it needs good eyes. Luke 11:34 says the light of the body is the eye; therefore when thine is single, thy whole body is full of light. Without good eyes, the whole body will be in darkness. Matthew 6:23 says if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. The eye is an organ of vision. Therefore the head is responsible for vision. Proverbs 29:18 says where there is no vision, the people perish. When we talk of vision, we mean spiritual vision i.e. seeing things the way God will sees them. The question is how does God see sin? He sees all sins as sin , there is no big sin or small sin ; all sins are sin. To be head means I will see sin as a sin i.e. I will see a lie as a sin not a white lie or blue lie. How does God see commitment to Him? Revelations 3:15 says I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. To God you either cold or hot, lukewarmness is an abomination to Him. To be the head means I will be very hot for the Lord. Spiritual vision also means following after the direction of God. To be the head means I will guide the people aright i.e. in the way of righteousness. When you say I shall be the head, what you are saying is that I will lead people in the part of righteousness.There are several advantages of having a good vision or seeing things the way God sees them. One of it is one begins to see his or herself surrounded by opportunities. In 2 Kings 4:1-7 is the story of a woman in big debt. She had a small jar of oil and was surrounded by people with empty vessels. She was surrounded by opportunities but could not see it. She ran to the man of God and that one asked her what she had. She said she had nothing except a jar of oil. Because the man of God could see, he told her she was surrounded with vast number opportunities i.e. there are other people around her with empty vessels. He told her to go and borrow the empty vessels and pour her oil in them; their poverty will make her rich. An individual who sees things the way God sees them will see the need of the people around and from the need of the people become prosperous. The individual will see a need for a service or goods around him, and from providing the goods or service he will become rich. Another advantage is one begins to see a way where there is no way. When the children of Israel saw Goliath, they saw an unbeatable champion, 1 Samuel 17:20-58. Actually they saw challenging Goliath to a fight as suicide. When David came to the scene, he not only saw that Goliath was beatable,he saw that his head could actually be severed from his body too. He aimed at his unprotected skull and immediately Goliath fell, he took his huge sword and cut off his head.\r\n\r\nKEY WORD: I shall be the head simply means I will begin to see things as God sees them not as men see them.It also means i will lead people in the path of righteousness.', 'Father, please bear my burdens for me.', '2013-02-27 17:55:13'),

This act of obedience demonstrated their acknowledgement of guilt, their repentance, their request for forgiveness, and their dependence upon the mercy of God. As the blood drained out of the sacrifice, it died and the price was paid. The blood of the sacrificial animal made "atonement" - which means "to cover" their sins - and God then forgave them. "The life of the flesh is in the blood" (Leviticus 17:11), and "without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness" (Hebrews 9:22 NIV). HERE''S THE CORE OF MY MESSAGE: However, the blood of sacrificial animals could never permanently atone for sin. People kept having to return with a new sacrifice to cover new disobediences. So God made one final sacrifice to forgive all our sins once and for all. He sent His only Son, Jesus, to die in our place.

According to the way God loves you, there is absolutely no way He can make you wait before He can give you that precious thing you are asking for. There is something you need to understand about God - God is a Faith God and He is Spirit. So, the fact that He has already given you something does not necessarily mean that you have to see it with your physical eyes. Remember, you yourself are NOT a body, you are a Spirit! Therefore, you should see in the spirit and don''t depend upon your physical eyes. Whenever you pray, you should see the answer already because you are a Spirit and you function in the Spirit. In that way, that answer which you see in the Spirit, will eventually materialize in the flesh! Always keep in mind: God does not function from the Physical to the Spirit, He functions from the Spirit to the Physical. Therefore, whenever you pray or ask for something, believe that God has done it for you in the Spirit; Believing also means that you have to see it with your spiritual eyes; Believing also means that you must begin to speak as someone who has already received it! Before God can do anything in the Physical, He starts it first in the Spirit! When God has completed something in the Spirit, it is then that He can do it in the flesh!', 'Dear Father, please help me to believe in you at all times. Help me Lord to always believe that whenever I pray you hear me and you answer me immediately. In Jesus'' Mighty Name I pray! Amen, Blessed be your Name Jesus!', '2012-05-22 03:48:16'),

So, if we live our lives based on physical evidence, then we cannot please God. Faith itself is the evidence of things not seen to the physical eye, yet they are visible to the spiritual eye. God does not want us to live based on what we can see, touch or feel, He wants us to live based on what He has done for us or has made us in the Spirit.

First John 3:9 is often used to support this doctrine: "Whoever has been born of God does not sin" (NKJV). If anyone sins - even in tiny ways - they believe that this proves they were never saved to begin with. They also note that Jesus told us to be "perfect" just as God is perfect (Matthew 5:48). However, it should be pointed out that the Greek word translated here as "perfect" means "complete," not sinless. But most Christians believe that a doctrine of complete sinlessness is unrealistic and, more importantly, goes against the overwhelming evidence of scripture. They point out that God has declared that our righteousness before Him is a divine gift imputed to us (credited to our account) because of our faith in Jesus Christ - even though we are weak, imperfect people (Romans 4:21-25). When God looks at us, He doesn''t see our lack of righteousness, but the righteousness of Christ whose blood washes away our sins. Jesus told his disciples to forgive a brother who kept on sinning and sinning against them (Matthew 18:21-22), evidence that believers aren''t exempt from sin. John makes this plain when he writes, "These things I write to you, so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ" (1 John 2:1 NKJV). Here John advised Christians to do their best to obey God and not to sin, but stated that if they did sin, to repent and turn to God for forgiveness - and yes, God would forgive them. "Well then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace? Of course not!" (Romans 6:1-2 NLT). So, there''s still forgiveness after Salvation, Praise the Lord for His Mercies which endure forever.', 'Dear Father, I thank you for the forgiveness and righteousness which I have received by your Grace.

Jesus would have been stoned had He declared this openly (John 10:29-33), so He usually called Himself "the Son of Man" - a lesser known reference to His eternal relationship with His Father (Daniel 7:13-14). God had made many promises in the Old Testament that He would send the Messiah (the "Anointed One") to deliver His people. The title "Christ" is the Greek translation of Messiah. Most Jews in Jesus'' day expected the Messiah to be a great warrior king who would deliver them militarily from their oppressors and then set up His kingdom. David had been Israel''s king a thousand years earlier, and God had promised that his kingdom would endure forever (2 Samuel 7:16). But now Israel had no king and was ruled by foreigners. The Jews of Jesus'' day longed for a great king of the royal house - the "Son of David" - to rise. Mary and Joseph were descendants of David, and the Jews often called Jesus the Son of David (Luke 2:1-7; 18:38). Also, Moses, the greatest prophet Israel had ever known, had promised that God would raise up a new Prophet like him to teach them to follow God (Deuteronomy 18:18-19; Acts 3:22-26). Some Jews thought the king and the prophet would be two different people, but others believed correctly that they would be one and the same (John 6:14-15).

But when Jesus put him to the test by asking him to give up his riches and follow Him, the man refused. Jesus then explained to His disciples that it is difficult for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God. The disciples then asked, "Who then can be saved?" And Jesus replied, "With man this is impossible" (Matthew 19:25-26 NIV). He didn''t answer that only very good people entered heaven. He said it was impossible for anyone to do so. Why? Because no one is truly good. However, Jesus added that with God all things are possible. God can make a way where there is no way. Yet Jesus had said, "Keep the commandments" - so which ones then, if not the Ten Commandments? Jesus later stated that the two greatest commands were to love God with all our hearts and to love our neighbor as ourselves (Matthew 22:35-40). The Apostle Paul said that those who obey these commands have fulfilled God''s law (Romans 13:8; Galatians 5:14). But remember that it''s impossible for even the ones who try to keep God''s commands, to be saved. So who can be saved??? Jesus told the religious leaders that tax collectors and prostitutes were entering the Kingdom of God ahead of them (Matthew 21:31). How could "sinners" find eternal life before "good" people? Because the sinners repented of their sins and trusted in Jesus to save them.

In this scripture the Apostle Paul teaches us that it is possible to be in Christ and still walk according to the flesh. Being in Christ and walking according to the flesh means that you are born-again, but you still desire the things of the world, you still do the things done by those who have not yet accepted Christ, you still carry the worldly behavior and the attitude of those who are not born-again, but in actual fact you are born-again and are in Christ. The part for "no condemnation" refers to those who are in Christ and walk according to the Spirit. Walking according to the Spirit means desiring the things of the Spirit, it means doing all things according to God''s Word and setting the Word of God as the standard of your life. So if you are in Christ and you still live according to the flesh, then you are heading towards condemnation because those who are in the flesh cannot please God (Rom 8:8). God is Spirit, so you cannot please Him unless you are in the Spirit. The only way in which you can remain in the Spirit is by abiding in the Word. The Word of God is the only way to Spiritual growth and maturity, there is no other way. The reason why there are those who are in Christ and still live according to the flesh is because they neglect the Word of God. The Word of God keeps us in the Spirit.

The thing which most of the brothers or men out there confuse and use to their own “narrow interests” is the part of "submission".\r\nNote that the Bible, before verse 22, in verse 21 says, "SUBMIT TO ONE ANOTHER out of reverence for Christ." So, not necessarily wives only must submit, but both constituencies in the relationship. And of course, this is to avoid domineering over the other party and so forth, as some men are in fact doing out there to suppress their counterpart.\r\n3. Love her (or him), as you love yourself. Because Christ loves the Church (His bride) as He loves himself too. Many are times the WORD of God emphasises this mere fact that when you marry you become as one and one body with your counter…\r\n\r\n**Due to the length of the devotion I think I will stop it here.

Many people live a life of control and manipulation, but yet there is something in them that God sees worthy of redeeming.\r\nIt does not matter how bad you may be, there is something inside of you that sees and cannot let die.\r\n A Defining Moment is:\r\n1.	The point at which the essential nature or character of a person is revealed or identified.\r\n2.	A very crucial moment\r\nClimax, decisive moment, loaded moment, moment of truth, point of no return, turning point.\r\n3.	It is that one moment in your life that changes everything.\r\nOur text is about the story of Jacob in which he tricked his father in getting the birth right instead of his brother Esau. Jacob is about to meet is brother after long years of separation.\r\nHere Jacob assumes his brother Esau is going to kill him supposedly for tricking his father to get his brother’s birth right. Jacob cleverly sends gifts ahead to his brother as a peace offering and spends the rest of the night in prayer asking God to spare his and his family life.\r\nThough Jacob’s life was characterized by control and manipulation, yet there was something in him that God found worthy of redeeming. Jacob no doubt had a heart that genuinely wanted to serve God and be used of God. This genuine desire was being hindered by traits in his life and God had to do something to chisel this bad traits. \r\nTo take away the bad traits in Jacob’s life, God sends an Angel in the form of a man to wrestle away the striving in him.  God will wrestle away from your life that one thing that will hinder your walk with him if you let him.\r\nThe only way God could remove the striving in Jacob was to injure his physical abilities. God will injure your physical abilities in order to remove the striving or bad traits within you.\r\nNotice when the Angel saw that he could not overpower Jacob, he touched the socket of his hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. (Gen.32:25-26)\r\nJacob’s natural abilities were so great that God literally had to make him a weaker man physically in order for God’s power to be manifested in his life. This was the “Defining Moment” in Jacob’s life.\r\nA new nature was birthed in him that required a total trust in God, erasing the old nature of control and manipulation. His name was changed in recognition of this “Defining Moment.”-\r\n“Then said the man, your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with man and have overcome.”(Gen. 32:28).\r\nI am skeptical of any Christian who does not walk with a limp. A limp Christian is the one who has wrestled with God and had his natural abilities injured and has come to a place of total dependence on God.\r\nOn the contrary a Christian who has not wrestled with God and natural abilities injured and has not come to a place of total dependence on God, will live a life of striving and manipulation. They are the same person.\r\nFor you to experience your defining moment in your life you will need to let go and let God do the work for you.\r\nYour defining moment is that Moment of Truth, the Loaded Moment, the Decisive Moment.\r\nYour defining moment is that point at which your true nature or character is revealed or identified. It is showing who you really are.\r\nWhen Jacob encountered and wrestled with the Angel, he was wrestling with his destiny and thus discovered his Defining Moment.\r\nYou too like Jacob can discover your Defining Moment. You can discover that moment when everything suddenly changes for you.\r\nTo experience the Defining Moment of your life, you must:\r\n1.	Have a heart to serve God\r\n2.

(167, '', 48, 'Know Him and the power of His resurrection!!! (Part 2)', 'Philippians 3:10', '"That I may know him,and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings,being made confortable unto his death.', 'KJV', 'The resurrection of Jesus Christ is \r\nthe standard of power in the New Testament. \r\nWhat is there after that? ... It is the miracle of miracles! I don''t think an Easter Sunday goes by, indeed it does not, in that I am not reminded of just a little phrase from an old hymn: "Today he rose and left the dead, and Satan''s empire fell." Sometimes I hear people say: "Lord, destroy the work of the devil." He has already destroyed the work of the devil! \r\nThe proof, the standard of God''s power in the New Testament is the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. The standard of God''s power in the Old Testament was the deliverance of the people of Israel through the Red Sea which brought them finally into the land of promise. In the Old Testament the miracle is the raising of a dead nation, because they were in captivity, in Egypt, which is a type of the world. They were under the dominion of Pharaoh, which is a type of the devil, and they were brought as the Word of God says, "God called them with a strong hand. He delivered them with a strong hand and a stretched out arm." \r\nAll the way from Moses to Malachi there is a constant referring to "Look what God did when He delivered Israel." Now, is anything bigger than that? Have you got a problem bigger than that? Can you imagine anything that demands on God more than that? So,\r\n     He delivered them.\r\n           He brought them out of captivity.\r\n               He snapped their fetters, and \r\n                     He led them by His own hand and His own arm. \r\nIn the New Testament the standard miracle, the standard of God''s power, is the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Then, because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, there is of course the resurrection of the individual from the dead. We are told so again and again. Ephesians 2 for instance says: "You have been quickened who were dead in trespasses and in sins." Now, he does not say that we will die. He says that we were dead. And the same miracle power that raised up Jesus from the dead is the power that raised us up from the dead.\r\nYou know, I don''t think it put any strain on God to make the world. He just created it. It did not put any strain on God to create light. He just spoke the word and said: "Let there be light," and there was light. But I am going to suggest to you that in a sense it put a strain on God to raise Jesus from the dead. In the sense that it tells us in Ephesians what is "the exceeding greatness of His power to us all who believe according to the working of His mighty power when He wrought in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and set as His own right hand in heavenly places." There is an awful lot of energy there! He says: "the exceeding greatness." You see, there are measures of God''s power exerted through the Word of God. Sometimes a thing doesn''t even cost God as much power as others. But it says here: "the exceeding greatness of His power towards us who believe according to the working of His mighty power which He WROUGHT in Christ when He raised Him from the dead." \r\nThere was a very tragic thing happened during the past week. A young couple with a very beautiful child discovered the child was missing. Sounded an alarm. Eventually they received a phone call to say that the child will be returned unharmed for JUST a couple of million dollars. The child happened to be the grandchild of one of the great tycoons in South America. A man who has made multi-millions of dollars out of tins. Immediately contact was made with him and of course he got everybody stirred up about this awful tragedy that happened in Europe. A child had been stolen. The demand was two million dollars. He said: "We''ll pay it." Now, do you think it took any energy for that man to reach over and take his check book and, having ten million dollars just write out a check for two million dollars? That demands no energy, only to write the check. But what I am going to suggest is that there was nothing in writing the check. There were awful anxieties and problems in his spirit, in his mind, everything was tormenting him. When he thought about all the possibilities that there were in getting that child back.\r\nTo interpret that this way: God said, "let there be light," and there was light. But I don''t think He said, "let there be Calvary," and there was Calvary. You are dealing here with moral and spiritual principles. You are dealing with powers of darkness. Now, Jesus Christ was a Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. And I think again that we forget so much of the agony of the Father from the time Jesus left the ivory palaces to come into a world of woe. The loneliness was on the behalf of the Father, because He had no one in heaven with whom He could communicate. And He sees His Friend going there to the cross. His Son is going to bear the whole sin of the whole world. There is only one way to do it ... as the hymn writer says: "Thou didst not spare Thine only Son, but gavest Him for a world undone." But you see, Calvary is the expression of the love of God.\r\nCalvary expresses the love of God.\r\nThe resurrection explains the power of God. \r\nYou think about all the colossal Epistles that Paul has written. He''s got the most amazing track record of any man that has ever lived outside of Jesus: \r\n      He has raised the dead,\r\n           he has opened the eyes of the blind,\r\n                he has cast out demons,\r\n                     he has written more epistles than all the other men put together.\r\n      AND YET HE SAYS: "I WANT TO KNOW HIM." \r\nIt isn''t that he does not know Him; he says there is a fuller revelation of Him. I''ve been thinking about this text for a few days. Then I read a letter from an old friend - he is 96 years old now - and it just fits right in with what I had been thinking. He said, "Ravenhill, I have been thinking about that word where Paul says ''That I may know Him and the POWER of His resurrection.'' Now look," he said, "for sixty years I''ve been trying to fathom that, but I do not understand the mystery of it. There is something there I can''t unearth."\r\nIt reminded me of when we were in Ireland. There was a little godly man by the name of Busby in a town called Dungannon. He was a strange character for sure; that is why he liked me, because we were both strange. He had a marvelous ministry of prayer and healing. One day we went to his little house, it wasn''t much more than a shack, and he said: "Well, I''ve got it, I''ve got it." "You got what?" "Remember I told you there is no water around here?" He had started digging a well four feet in diameter. It was a heart breaking job, but he is a muscular man. He had been a weight lifter, though he was only about five feet high he had a tremendous physique. He went down fourteen feet and then he came to a slab of rock. As hard as any rock you ever saw in your life. And his friend said: "Well, Smarty, there you are. What are you going to do now?" He said: "Shift the rock. It''s a plug. And when I pull that plug the water is going to come." He just turned that rock on one side and water poured out. He could hardly get out of the well fast enough.\r\nYou know, when I read what my old friend said I thought: that''s right. There is something in this word resurrection that as yet we have not fathomed. There is a plug here if you like, we''ve got to lift it and discover what there is lying underneath it.\r\nLook again at Paul. Man I would be intoxicated with joy if I had a ministry like it. I get people sometimes who say: "You wrote me a letter; it turned my life around." Well, I thank God I can be His servant in that...

We are in essence making Him not just Saviour but Lord of our lives. \r\nPersonal time alone with God. Whenever we set apart time to spend alone with God we are purposely drawing near to God. Jesus made this a priority in His life as our example. “And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed” (Mark 1:35 KJV).

John wrote, “No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us” (1 John 4:12 NASB).

(179, '', 48, 'Thinking through temptations!!', 'Hebrews 4:15', 'Just because we have been tempted, we have not become defiled. Jesus was also tempted in all points and that did not make Him a sinner.', 'NIV', 'Our mind is the battleground where temptations are fought through, and our thoughts are what are exchanged in the battle. The attack comes in the form of thoughts that are propelled by the desires in our flesh (Jas.1:14). These thoughts may come from our own mind as a result of associations with similar situations in the past. They may be ideas that are whispered into our minds by Satan or his evil spirits in the same way as he did with Jesus (Mt.4:3), or they may come from other people. When this attack comes, the temptation begins. \r\n\r\nAt this point it is still only a temptation and not sin. Just because we have been tempted, we have not become defiled. Jesus was also tempted in all points and that did not make Him a sinner (He.4:15). It becomes sin only when we yield our heart to it, by doing what the temptation sugggests or by enjoying the sinful pleasures we get by letting imaginations run in the direction of the temptation (Jas.1:15). But if we stop the temptation right there, and refuse to yield to it, we become victors in the battle. \r\n\r\nMost temptations are simple in nature, enticing us to do something that we know to be wrong. To sin is to do it, and to overcome is to resist doing it. But there are also temptations that are not so straightforward, where we are not sure what we should do. In such cases we may need to spend a long time waiting on the Lord, seeking to know what He would have us to do. When Jesus prayed three times in Gethsemane asking the Father whether He really wanted Him to go to the cross or there was another way to achieve the Father''s goal without having to go through the suffering, it was this kind of temptation. The agony of this temptation was so great that Jesus sweated drops of blood during the process. It is comforting for us to know that even though Jesus took so long to decide or prayed the same prayer three times it did not amount to sin. \r\n\r\nAnother kind of temptation is where we know in our heart what is right and wrong, but we are too weak to reject the sinful suggestion straightaway. The attractions are so great that we waver in making a decision. We keep hoping that perhaps it would be all right if we give in, trying to justify ourselves or imagining that God may agree to it just this time. We know deep in our heart that it would be wrong to give in, but we are not spiritually strong enough to quit on the spot. Of course this is not the best way to deal with temptations, but this is a part of growing up. I suggest that God would consider it ''not sin'' as long as we are fighting against the temptation, and that it would become sin only if we give in. He knows that we are weak, and that we are struggling with the temptation. It is this struggle that marks the strength of temptation.', 'Our ultimate goal is to overcome in temptation.

He established a model of a man that has entirely set out in his heart to seek the LORD and find him and have that special relationship with Him.\r\n\r\nFinally, the reason why speak to ourselves in psalms is because of such a phenomenal journey David set out and committed even himself and all to discover His God... and when you just meditate on these scriptures of Psalms you''ll find David so inspired to know God and His Power, and no wonder why he was "a man after God''s own heart".', 'Confession: "As my quest and honest desire of knowing more of You [LORD], I speak to myself in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs.

As a messenger of the Most High God, I have been instructed to sound the trumpet, and engage the enemy whose goal is to easily beset us from the plan of God in the body of Christ! I am not here to entice you with man''s wisdom, but rather to call this nation to repentance, and the church as well!\r\nFor too long, there has been organizations that have tried to silence the ordinances of God, to pursue their own agendas, and for that, they are in extreme error, and will face Godly judgement, whereby even I, will be judged. Let no man stand in his own pride, and suffer a diabolical fall to bonds, but rather, let every man repent and reconcile each one himself to God. I pray that all will come in humbleness before the throne of grace, and come into light the saving knowledge of the truth.\r\nThe fivefold ministry has been one of the greatest keys to successful ministry in every church. For those churches who do not operate in those five, are damaged very severely, and the growth will not be where it should be! I have visited many churches who didn''t allow these offices to operate because of two distinct reasons:\r\n1) They didn''t have a full understanding of each office.\r\n2) Control issues within the church.\r\nWhenever a church is operating within these fivefold offices, then church organizations no longer are in control. The Pastors are no longer in control. God is in control! I am going to explain each office, and what each office pertains to. There is no way that I can go into complete detail of what each does, for the sake of time and space, this will be a general overview of each office, so that you can understand better. My goal is to explain each office, so that those who are called into ministry (in which, we all are) may get to know what office they are clearly called into. This is vital for each one to know.\r\nFirst, I want to break down the scripture above, so that you have a clear understanding of what Paul was writing in the Spirit to the Ephesian church:\r\nEphesians 4:11\r\nAll offices are separated by semi-colons. Why? because each office separated means that it is exclusive from the others- this is on purpose. Notice that Pastors and Teachers are together? Why? the omission of the Pastor and Teachers together, seems to indicate that Pastors and Teachers are included under one class. The two belong together. No man is fit to be a Pastor who cannot also teach, and the Teacher needs the knowledge which Pastoral experience gives.\r\nEphesians 4:12\r\n"For the perfecting of the saints..." Hmm...so this means that the saints cannot reach perfection unless there is a fivefold ministry in the church? That''s ludacris, right? No...\r\n"For the work of the ministry..." Who is this talking about here? That''s right! The saints! To perfect the saints so that they can work in the ministry that they''ve been called in!\r\n"For the edifying (building) of the body of Christ;" See, the body of Christ today, is not really the true body of Christ, why? Because the body of Christ consists of ministries as a whole, in one mind and in one accord! Today we have too many bench-warmers, too much competition with other ministers, and too much control by man (Pastors, organizations, monetary substance and even family members), and not enough God in the mix!\r\nEphesians 4:13\r\n"Till we all come to the untiy of the faith..." Without the Fivefold ministry in the church, there are disagreements, discontent, backbiting, slander, maiiciousness, greed, envy, strife, fornication, adultery, and pride! When we all have a common job to do, we find ourselves reaching and preaching for that common goal. A God-given goal! It is to be all in one mind and in one accord...\r\n"and of the knowledge (full discernment) of the Son of God..." This is only revealed by the Spirit of truth, therefore "discernment"...\r\n"Unto a perfect man.." Why does it say here a perfect man? Because we are to be ONE! One perfect man (Christ). This is where it gets deep, so I''ll save that for another blog. Let''s put it this way: When God sees us (in Christ''s stead), He sees us as one in him, not apart (or separate) from Him!\r\n"unto the measure of the stature (maturity) of the fulness of Christ (upon and in the earth);" This goes back to that perfct man that I explained. So what are these callings, and what do they entail? Let''s take a look, shall we?\r\nApostles\r\nApostles pioneer churches. They build them from the ground up. They establish them. They have special inspiration from God, and are given supreme authority over the churches (this is why denominations have ruled them out). True Apostles are accredited by signs and miracles following their ministry (self-proclaimed "Apostles" do not), Apostles have an unlimited commission to preach the Gospel and found churches. Apostles oversee and are responsible for every church that they have pioneered.\r\nProphets\r\nProphets are known as "Spiritual Cowboys". They are to drive the body in a certain direction. They do this by adhering to the voice of God, and then by protecting, warning, challenging, and directing the body of Christ to go a certain way! Prophets/Prophetesses are called by God, and God alone. Prophets expound under the immediate influence of the Holy Ghost, and thus extinguished from Teachers. Prophets are somewhat in a category all their own. They are peculiar, somewhat weird to church and society, and are oftentimes abandoned by man because of their being misunderstood by mainstream religious groups. True Prophets of God are dealt with by God and God alone. They are oftentimes trained in ministry alone, with some guidance by other true Prophets appointed over them, as in a ''school of Prophets'' as Elisha attended, but not every true Prophet of God is called in this way (As Elijah and Jeremiah). False "Prophets" are mainly ''soothsayers", often known as a ''slithering tongued serpent'', tickling the ears to gain your trust. This world is full of them! True Prophets of God can operate as an Evangelist, Pastor or Teacher. Prophets are also followed by signs and miracles when directed by God to do so. They only speak the oracles of God, and are assisted by God to carry out the Prophet''s assignment. Apostles and Prophets oftentimes walk together. They are both over the Evangelist, Pastor and Teacher.\r\nEvangelist\r\nThe Evangelist has the job of the missionary. His job is to go out into the highways and biways and compel them to come in. They are used to ''gather'' new converts into the fold or flock (church body). Many Evangelists travel, and are to be constantly on the road, except for the time of ''refreshing'' or encouragement from other ministries within the body of Christ (not necessarily a "home" church). The Evangelist works hand-in-hand with the Pastor and Teacher, although the Pastor is over the Teacher.\r\nPastors & Teachers\r\nPastors and Teachers fall into the same category because they work hand-in-hand . One accents the other. Pastors and Teachers work directly with a certain "church" or body, to help them to discover their calling and start to move into that calling by training and yes, on-hands training. Pastors main job is to "shepherd" the flock, or ''oversee'', to make sure to keep out the "snakes" and "wolves" (that is; false teachers or decievers). Teachers teach foundational truths of the Word of God, building the foundation of our faith.\r\nIn conclusion; Organizations are not to be dictators. Organizations are not to be rulers. \r\n \r\nNeither are Pastors! It is the order of God! Once again, this is the order of God:\r\n1) Apostles\r\n2) Prophets\r\n3) Evangelists\r\n4) Pastors\r\n5) Teachers\r\nOrganizations are formed by man, and not God! Organizations have become man-made empires that have been designed to suppress (control) people (I need to interject here by stating this: Some organizations didn''t start this way, but over time, they became this way). Many try to dictate the move of God, as do many Pastors. Organizations are oftentimes formed to try and adhere to an Old Testament way of doing things. Trying to adhere to an Old Testament order of the Priesthood, not adhering to the truth that we are all made Kings and Priests by Christ to the order of Melchizedek as in Revelation 1:6.\r\nAs long as Apostles and Prophets are silenced, then this puts the Pastor the head of the church (and not Christ). This is why many churches put the Pastor upon a pedestal, as if he is revered as the same as the Pope or Priest is in the Catholic church. Many Pastors are treated respectfully as "holy" men of valor and faith, whether they are in the right or not! Sad but true. It has gotten to a place anymore that unless you''re a Pastor, you''re not taken seriously as a Preacher, and this is blatantly wrong in the eyes of Almighty God! We all have an important role, and this has got to be exposed for what it is! We have developed a thing called "protestant faith", which comes from the root word "Protest", meaning we protest Roman Catholicism, yet we adhere to their ways of ''church government''.\r\nWhen will we get back to the way God intended it to be? When will we lay aside our pride and realize that the least (humble) shall become the greater in the Kingdom of Heaven. This is not about who is over whom, but rather, that the kingdom of Heaven can be filled with men and women and children of all nations, regardless of race, age, or creed. The more, the merrier!\r\nThis is not about the "power" or position of the calling itself, because the ''higher'' the calling, the higher the price, the heavier the burden, and the more the sacrifice. That''s just the way it is, trust me! It''s about a true church. A church without spot or blemish. A church that doesn''t experience defeat. A church full of POWER!!! A church that is truly called by His Name.\r\n\r\nShalom.', 'Father, help me to know who I am in you, and my office in the 5-fold.', '2012-06-27 07:41:51'),

Why in the world would God ask Abraham to give up that gift? In my opinion, it is for the same reason He asked me to call off my wedding. God wants us to love Him more than we love His promises. The minute we get those out of order, He readjusts us.”\r\nWhile we don’t fully know the mind of God in Abraham’s situation, Pike’s simple thought sheds light on a struggle I think all of us encounter at some time in our lives – the struggle to love God above everything else, even His blessings. God wants us to love Him because of who He is, not what He can give us. Yet, how often do we confuse our love of God’s promises with love of Him? How often do we see Him as the divine blessing machine, ready to dole out happiness on our terms? The popularity of "prosperity theology" reveals how easy it is for believers to twist love of God into the pursuit of earthly happiness.\r\nTo be honest, it’s not just greed that gets in the way of loving God. It’s also a limited understanding of who God is. I used to wonder how some Christians could sit for over an hour praying. Is God really that interesting? I’d wonder. This type of thinking reveals a fundamental flaw in how I perceived God, and I think that flaw is what keeps many from coming to Christ in the first place. It’s easy to see Him as limited like we are limited. It’s easy to forget that God is truly our all in all. As C.S. Lewis once said, “God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself, because it is not there. There is no such thing.”\r\nStill, had I not gone through a similar situation, I might not have believed Pike’s sincerity when she says: "I am thankful for His grace that saved me from ruining my life by pursuing my dream."\r\nIn a “reach for the stars, be anything you can be” culture, the idea that pursuing any dream could ruin my life seems foreign. The more I think about it, though, the more I see that living outside God’s will – even if it is for a “good reason” – is a recipe for failure.\r\nYet, when we give up our dreams for something greater - for Someone greater than ourselves - we begin to see we can trust God no matter what. We find solace in the incredible peace that comes with knowing that even if life here includes sorrow or dreams unfulfilled, there is a God that transcends not only all that’s missing in this life, but also all the good this life has to offer.', 'Lord help to seek you for the right reasons,sometimes our method''s are right but our motives are wrong,help us in this time and despensation to do the right thing.Amen', '2012-07-03 05:18:58'),

But when I came to chapter nine, something new jumped out at me. I began to see the word "rejection," although it was not in written form. Perhaps I saw what I was feeling that day—rejected.\r\nI was reading at the part of the story where Saul, a murderer, had just been transformed into Paul, a disciple of Christ. Even though Paul was a changed person, many rejected him because of his past reputation and lifestyle. Not only that, but as Paul became fully devoted to serving Christ—sacrificing his education, his life, and remaining single so he could better serve the Lord—he was falsely accused, thrown into prison more than once and shipwrecked on several occasions. Doesn''t that seem odd for a man called of God? Wouldn''t God''s favor protect him from such adversity?\r\nI thought about an illness that had lingered with me for months. It was so severe I was all but bed-ridden week after week, unable to do life and ministry. I had felt rejected by God. It didn''t make sense. I was serving Him in more ways than I could count. Then, without warning, strong winds came and ushered what felt like a storm into my life. Clouds hung overhead and before I knew it, I felt "shipwrecked."\r\nPerhaps, you''ve been there, too. Maybe you''ve been rejected by family, friends, and co-workers. Or you''ve been falsely accused. Maybe you''re imprisoned by finances, or being blown around by the consequences of someone else''s sin?\r\nIt seems so unfair. You''ve tried to live right. You walk in obedience the best you can. You take God at His Word and trust in His promises. Shouldn''t faith like this call for smooth sailing, instead of stormy, shipwrecking seas?\r\nIf we follow Paul''s journey, we find God working through the rejection, the trials, the prison time, and the shipwrecks. Paul shared the gospel with the Pharisees through his rejection and imprisonment. People saw God''s power at work when Paul survived the storms, when the snake bite didn''t kill him, and when the jail shook—opening doors and loosing chains.\r\nPaul didn''t let his circumstances wreck him with a sense of rejection. He didn''t allow self-pity and doubt to overtake him. Instead, we see in Acts 16:22-31 that after being stripped, beaten, severely flogged, thrown in the inner cell of a prison and his feet in stocks, Paul prayed and sang hymns to God. And others around him were listening. The power of God came in such a way that the prison guard begged Paul to tell him, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" He replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus" (vs. 30b-31, NIV).\r\nGod kept His promise to work all things together for the good of this man who loved Him and was called according to His purposes. As Paul depended on God and trusted His faithfulness in the midst of his adversity, many witnessed God''s power and believed. And the same is true for us. God doesn''t waste our pain, our rejection or our "shipwrecks." He uses them to bring about His plan—to position us so that others can see His transforming power at work in our lives and believe in the living God.\r\n\r\nIf that''s true, and it is, then our challenge is to rise from the wreckage, like Paul, so that our lives will give testimony that draws others to the Jesus. Today I will no longer sit on the sidelines of life full of self-pity. I choose to rise, pray and praise, so that God can position me to shine for His glory, and so that others will believe.', 'Dear Lord, forgive me for wallowing in self-pity and rejection. I trust that You see the bigger picture. I believe there is a purpose for my pain. Strengthen me to rise from my ashes so that others will see You are my help and my salvation.

The old\r\nwritten covenant ends in death; but\r\nunder the new covenant, the Spirit gives\r\nlife.', 'New Living Translation (©2007)', 'Most of us are constantly coming across questions pertaining the new covenant and the old. And one of the questions is: why is there such a HUGE difference between now (or the new covenant/testament) and the old testament; well, mostly in terms of practice and the way things were done or even happened? And my answer is that: because there old covenant was merely a shadow of things to come with and in the new covenant. The old is the ''Commandment-covenant'' and the new,  the ''Blood-covenant''... One was demonstrated in the role of God - as the Father, the other, again, in the role of God - as the Son. Later there came a time for the Spirit [and He''s role] -- as part and parcel of the new covenant''s promises. The old covenant was a shadow of the realities and things to come and the new is the substance - the original form. Colossians 2:16\r\n\r\n"We are not like Moses. He kept covering his face with a veil. He didn''t want the people of Israel to see the glory fading away." 2 Corinthians 3:13 (Exodus 34:33) GOD''S WORD. From this scripture, one can clearly see the two covenants being presented here: 1) The problem with the old is that the Glory, manifesting in the physical, was only temporal and of vanity; 2) The Glory of the new covenant as my friend would say is back where it belongs - in the spiritual. The Glory is perpetually eternal! That is why if you are going to be after "the works" of God, like the Israelites were, you''re going to be permanently short-sighted ... Be after "the plan" of God, like Moses was, in his service to God.

These kind of sufferings are not the ones of being poor or being in need of money; these are the kind of sufferings where we are not received by the world.

(223, '', 48, 'HOW TO MOTIVATE YOUR  CONGREGATION!!', '1 Peter 4:10', '“As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God”', 'NASB', 'Preach (motivate with) the Word. The bible says, “Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching” ( 2 Timothy 4:2 NKJV). Tell them what God expects – motivate them through the Word. He expects His people to be involved and use the gifts He has given them. “As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God” (1 Peter 4:10 NASB). God promises His Word will not return to Him void (Isaiah 55:10-11). It is the responsibility of the fivefold ministry to equip and motivate our people “for the work of the ministry” (Ephesians 4:11-13). Let’s challenge them with the Word of God!\r\nBe positive. When motivating your people always be as positive as you can. Negativism beats the people down. Jesus said, “Feed my sheep” (John 15:16 KJV) not beat my sheep. Challenge them in the most positive way you possibly can. This will build them up spiritually, mentally and emotionally for the task God has gifted and called them to.\r\nEncourage your people. Always be encouraging both in your preaching and personal contact. Let them know you believe in them and know they “can do all things through Him who strengthens me” – them (Philippians 4:13 NASB). Encourage them to try different ministries and areas of involvement until they find what God has called them to. Challenge them that once they find their function in ministry it will bring them the greatest fulfillment in life they could ever imagine.\r\nTrain in small increments. Don’t overwhelm them. Give them small tasks in particular areas of involvement that won’t take long to complete. Long term commitments will often seem overwhelming and they will be afraid to commit or even try. Let me give a couple of brief examples. You can do this in similar ways in nearly any area of ministry.\r\n1. Let them teach a class. If you wanted to test them out in teaching a class you might ask if they would mind helping out in a particular class for only two or three weeks. Only request they do a specific portion of the class and observe the primary teacher the remainder of the class time. If they seem to fit and feel comfortable you can expand it by asking them to do another week or two and ad another portion of the class to what they have been doing.\r\nIn doing it this way, you are not making a long term commitment either. If they appear to be a gifted teacher you can continue moving them forward. If it does not seem to be their area of expertise – you are both off the hook. You can test them out in a different area of ministry at another time.\r\n2. Evangelism. Let’s say you were wanting to motivate your people toward door to door evangelism. (This can be true for any area of evangelism.) If you attempt to get them to go out with you every week, most people would be afraid to even try. If, however, you spend a few weeks promoting evangelism and end with challenging them to go out with you for only two Saturdays and for just one to two hours maximum, many could muster up enough courage to give it a try. You might find many of your people getting fired up for soul winning. You could then repeat this every six months or yearly.\r\nUse incentives. Reward is basic to life. We work every week because we are promised a pay check. God also rewards our service for Him (1 Corinthians 3:9-15 and 2 Corinthians 5:10-11). Our people need encouraged that God will reward their service for Him. We are saved by grace but reward is earned.\r\n\r\nUsing more immediate incentives can help motivate our people to get involved and be productive. For instance, if you are trying to get your people to bring visitors to church, you might have some sort of contest. The contest should have some kind of reward or prizes for the person, couple or family who brings the most visitors in a limited time period. Many restaurants and other businesses will give out gift certificates for specials things if they know it will promote their business.\r\nUse your imagination. There are all kinds of things you can do to offer incentives to your people that will encourage involvement. You might try an Internet search for additional ideas. Hopefully this has given you a beginning place and the Holy Spirit will guide you from here and stir your imagination.\r\nAwards. It is always a good idea to have an award ceremony once or twice a year for the workers you have. This can be a wonderful source of encouragement for their service to the Lord and the local church. Bringing attention to those who are presently being used of God in the local church may also be an encouragement for those sitting on the sidelines to get involved.\r\nSet attainable goals. As Pastors, we often have an overall vision for what we believe God wants for our ministry. This is great for “Where there is no vision, the people perish” (Proverbs 29:18 KJV). However, people need to see things in more short term increments. They need to be able to see the fruit of their labor. One of our greatest challenges is to break down our vision (goals) into smaller segments – something our people can see in the not so distant future.

Well, simply because, that''s what the WORD of God says right!? But there''s another critical aspect of Jesus''s ministerial life to consider. He was a man of sorrows and grief, the Bible tells us. But, what could this mean to us today as the Church (or the Ecclesia) and Body of Christ, as the Bible constantly informs us that we should imitate Christ and be more like Him? Think about it, meanwhile. Actually, the many sorrows Jesus had were not only because people had rejected and despised Him but this was also because wherever, as we conclude, Jesus went, He would see so much chaos and inconsistencies, and nonalignment with the WORD and ultimately feel so much weight on His shoulders as a result. Some of these examples could be that the world is perverse; there are worldly orders and systems to pull down and destroy; the are lies and there is falsehood to counter; and the people are not so much convinced by the Power of God to advance His Kingdom on earth and take domain on earth, as God had given them in the beginning.

God now has parental instincts towards you. You''re a member of God''s Household, and therefore a permanent citizen of Heaven where He dwells. You are a partaker of His divine nature. God is now responsible for you, just as any parent is responsible for their child. He will supply all your needs according to His inexhaustible riches in glory by Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:19). You are a love child of a love God, and you''re born into a love family. Live each and every day of your life in celebration and joy, because you are just like God, you possess His very nature. OOOOOHHHH what a privilege this is, to be exactly like God right in this world. Thank you Lord for your amazing Love towards me.', 'In the name of Jesus, I am a partaker of God''s divine nature.

The world and all that is in it was created for our enjoyment and pleasure and points us to a good God who loves us and desires our good pleasure. However, something is wrong.\r\nOften we hear that the world is evil and that we should avoid it and remain separate from it. As followers of Jesus, we can be confused by the notion the world Christ created and came to redeem is evil. Are we not to be in the world? What does Scripture mean regarding "not loving the world or the things in the world"? What does "friendship with the world is enmity with God" look like? How do we make sense of "not being in the world" or "not being friends with the world" in light of God placing us here in this world at this specific time? Something must be wrong in the world. Advertisement\r\nThe apostle John, who spoke of not loving the world, defines his terms in 1 John 2:15-17 when he said, "Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever."\r\nSeveral observations can be made from 1 John 2:15-17. The first observation: John defines what he means by the world in verse 16. John describes three specific categories of sin that must be avoided in the world. This sin is what John is referring to as the world. \r\n(1)	The lust of the flesh.\r\n(2)	The lust of the eyes.\r\n(3)	The pride of life. \r\nThese three sins are similar to the temptations Adam and Eve faced in the Garden of Eden—succumbing to which is what destroyed their relationship with God, as well as destroyed all that was to be right and good in the world.\r\n(1)	They were tempted by their physical needs and ate the fruit, choosing it above their relationship with God. This was the result of giving in to lust of the flesh.\r\n    (2)They were tempted by desiring that which would harm them because it looked pleasurable. This was the lust of the eye.\r\n   (3)They were tempted to be their own god. When the serpent said they would be like God if they ate the fruit, this was the pride of life (See Gen. 3).\r\nThese three sins, "the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life," are depicted in Jesus'' own temptation in the wilderness in Matthew 4, as well. Here, Jesus was tempted to sin against God by pursuing worldly things rather than God. He was tempted by His physical needs, the lust of the flesh, when He was tempted to turn the stones into bread.\r\nNext, Jesus was tempted to do something spectacular by throwing Himself off the temple and having His angels recue Him, the lust of the eyes.\r\nFinally, Jesus was tempted to receive all the kingdoms of the world if He worshiped Satan; this is idol worship and the pride of life (See Matt. 4:1-11).\r\nThese three temptations that Jesus resisted in the wilderness mirror Adam and Eve''s temptations and sin in Garden and reflects what John defines as loving the world, the sins of "the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life."\r\nThe next observation we can make from John in verse 17: "the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever" is that he was warning us against sins that lead to death and about pleasures in sin that are not eternal. He was saying these pleasures will not last and instead lead to death. John was contrasting clearly the differences between the temporary sins and pleasures in this life and the eternal pleasures to come. John''s concern was for the believer to have an eternal perspective and not to place stock in temporary pleasures, which all are fleeting. The pleasures of this temporary world are not comparable with the pleasures and blessings to come in eternity with God. God has our best in mind. \r\nThe final observation we can make from John is from the context of his whole letter. From the context, we find John concludes his letter with an appeal to his readers to "keep yourselves from idols" (1 John 5:21). John was saying that loving the world and the things in the world above God is idolatry. Simply put, John was speaking against idol worship. John goes on to say in 1 John 5:18-21:\r\n"We know that whoever is born of God does not sin; but he who has been born of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him. We know we are of God, and the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one. We know the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding, that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen."\r\nJohn is not the only biblical author who defined terms such as this. James also defined loving the world or friendship with the world as idol worship. In James 4:4-5, James speaks of pride and unfaithfulness to God as unfaithfulness and adultery, "Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. Or do you think the Scripture says in vain, ''The Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously?''" James emphasizes that our God is a jealous God and desires our worship and well-being.\r\nThis world was created good. The world and all that is in it was created for our enjoyment and pleasure. However, sin has marred the world''s goodness, and its charms have strived for our affections under the influence or sway of Satan. God desires us. God yearns for us jealously and desires to give us so much more than what the world can offer. As far as we see beauty and goodness through sin''s shadows in this world, that goodness is pointing us to Someone better, the Author of life itself, God. God knows the pleasures and sin in this world can lead us away from Him and can harm us. God also knows this world is passing away, and He knows He is going to make all things new. God desires our best and wants our good pleasure in Him, in this lifetime and in the next.', 'May we not be led astray by "the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life."

Of course, ''Readiness'' & ''Faith'' are friends, or should I say Big Friends or should I say tight buddies. Yes, you have faith for it, but the question is, ARE YOU READY FOR IT? Yes, you have faith for a job, the question is: if you can be called for an interview unexpectedly, will you be ready for it? Have you prepared yourself for the interview?

You have faith for high marks at school this year, the question is, are you preparing for your exams? Friends, faith without actions/works is dead. It is totally meaningless. A wise farmer always makes sure that his fields are ready for the rain. A wise learner always makes sure that he/she is ready for any exam or test that comes.

The fact that you don''t see any clouds in the sky, doesn''t mean its not gonna rain. Just keep your fields ready at all times. This is the attitude which pleases God. Without Faith we cannot please God (Heb 11:6). Faith requires you to behave like someone who knows that things will happen; And when you know that things will happen you will obviously prepare for them, because faith is a friend to readiness, and readiness is a friend to faith.

We can talk about the Divine Nature of God and I am sure all of us have something to say and some understanding of what is the Divine Nature of God.

Part of equipment for a King is a Scepter (to govern, by righteousness),  an Orb (which could an object symbolic of what a king defends and stands for in his ruling), a Crown, with special and most expensive stones (which is significant of not only the status of the king as king but the wealth of his kingdom as well), Anointing, well you know what that is for and etc. I could go on but I didn''t want to get this far with revelation.

Isn''t it amazing the patience and the ability to endure God has given to a woman. A woman is a kind of creature that can endure almost any kind of situation life can throw at her. Why is it that women are the ones who become pregnant and not men? Why should a woman be the one to carry a baby for 9 months in them and not a man? This is because of the inexplicable character God has given to a woman. A woman has the ability to value. A woman has the ability to treasure. A woman has the ability to cherish. These are some of the reasons why over 50% of the responsibility of bringing a life to earth has been laid upon a woman. Sometimes a woman is only recognized by the pain she goes through. This is the reason why the Bible does not give us the name of the woman with the issue of blood, but it only describes her by her painful situation. Yet in any painful situation, a woman still has the courage to touch the hem of His garment. A woman is reliable. This is the reason why a woman was trusted by God to carry the Saviour in her womb. A woman can stand through out tough times. This is the reason why women were present when Jesus was crucified (Luke 23:27; Mark 15:40). A woman can be trusted. This is one of the reasons why Jesus appeared first to a woman after He was resurrected (Mark 16:9). A woman is very responsible and will never neglect her responsibility. The evidence of a woman''s responsibility is seen in Mark 16:1 which reads, "Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, that they may come and anoint Him." These women knew that they had to anoint the body of Jesus and they would have never let down that particular responsibility. We should all be thankful to God for women and the characters they posses.', 'Heavenly Father, we thank you that you have given us the gift to posses wombs, for this is our unique possessions.

From the opening scripture one may be aware that it speaks in two folds: Jesus gave them Power, which in the Greek Lexicon is Dunamis, the direct translation of Power (and particularly the Power that the Bible is talking about here), and then He gave them Authority, which is also found in the Greek Lexicon as Exousia (ex-oo-SEE-ah) meaning Authority (and particularly the Authority that the Bible talks about here). There are three things I would like to share with you today on this subject about ‘the magnificent Power of God in us’: 1. Dunamis (Power), 2. Exousia (Authority or Divine Authority) and, 3. ''Creative Ability''. Maybe most of us are particularly familiar with the scripture in 1Corinthians 4:20 that says, "For the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power", right. That''s right; it''s in power. That''s even how it stands out in the first place and supposedly can prove to every living creature and principalities that it''s of the most high, right! While ''dunamis'' implies the ability to make power felt, ''exousia'' affirms that free movement is ensured to the ability. In other words, authority (exousia) affirms that we have the freedom to exercise the power (dunamis) or make the power (dunamis) felt. Let’s read again the book of Acts, Acts 1, the Bible says “And you shall receive Power when the Holy Ghost comes on you… And let’s pair it with Micah 3 it reads [on the third verse] “But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the LORD…” Do we all follow the logic here?? Thank God! But the third aspect that I find equally interesting is the part about the “creative ability”. This simply means the ability to function as God. I’ll explain: God used words, for instance, to create all things that are seen and not seen (invincible). So I have the same “creative ability” in my MOUTH to create, because I’m created and fashioned in His image and likeness. So all this power resides in me??!! That is ‘the magnificent power of God in us’ for you! I hope you are blessed. Now show-off the power!', 'As I come more in the knowledge of the Power of God, Holy Spirit I understand that you are the energizer; the Power of God in me!

And when they talk about the anointing, all they know about is the anointing for "breaking bondages" and setting people free. That''s about all they know! You say: what is the anointing? They say "the Power of God to break the yoke". But that''s not all the anointing does. And because of the misunderstanding of what the anointing does, a lot of the devil''s kids are doing "BIG" things and a lot of God''s kids are doing "little" things. Are you still there? It''s because of the misunderstanding of the anointing. The Bible tells us that Satan (the Lucifer) was the anointed cherub. He was called the anointed cherub that covereth. And that anointing was a different anointing that Satan (then Lucifer) had. That is the anointing that most of God''s children don''t understand; they don''t know it. But that anointing has been made available to the Church, but we just haven''t known it. When you understand ''that'' anointing with the few things I''ll tell you about it tonight, you will see why anything you do can turn into success, by the application of that anointing. The Hebrew word for that anointing is the word ''mimshack''. Word says that Satan was the anointed cherub; it uses ''mimshack'' for that anointing. The anointing that was given to Satan (then Lucifer), it was the ''mimshack'' anointing. That anointing, the meaning of the word ''mimshack'' means ''expansion''; it means ''spreading''. So Satan understood that anointing, that why when non-Christian musicians, when they release their album and dedicate it to Satan it spreads all around the world in a matter of days. Why? Because of the Mimshack Anointing! Now, Satan''s anointing was NOT taken from him, he corrupted it; so it''s a corrupted anointing. So it''s working but not producing God''s results; but it''s working! It''s called the anointing for ''expansion''. And many of God''s children don''t understand it; so Satan''s kids are still using it. That''s why he (satan) delivers it to them (the non-Christians) in their businesses. They start-up a business and it spreads; it expands. The believer with anointing for "breaking yokes" starts-up a business and and then, there are no yokes to break, so, nothing works. Hahaha... You see why he speaks in tongues and he''s still not making progress. Why? Because he has converted he''s anointing for casting out devils only.

Look at Jesus, He functioned in that anointing: He had 12 men, before long He had a multitude of disciples. Now, look at it, ALL OVER THE WORLD – HE’S GOT PEOPLE CALLING “THE BLESSED NAME OF JESUS”. Look at His Church, He said “I will build my Church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” He says [in the city of Ephesus] so mightily grew the WORD of God and prevailed. The word PREVAILED. Why? The anointing for spreading. The anointing for expansion. You need to function in that anointing… It is not by might, it is not by power but my Spirit (or ‘Anointing’) says the LORD. Look at David, look at Goliath. It doesn’t matter how many giants of that industry are present in that business. You can come in like the young David with that Mimshack Anointing. It won’t take you long… you’ll become number 1!!

But I am here to defy some certain beliefs about some things in life that could catapult us if we''d gotten the revelation. We''re challenging the norm! Now, back to scripture, the WORD of God says in the book of Genesis 7, God gave them (Noah and his household, and all of the animals that were paire, as God had instructed) seven days to enter into the ark before the flood came... Now, let''s break it down: the Bible doesn''t mention anywhere were He may have given some ''grace'' to the animal such as the tortoise and snail to move ahead and enter the ark days earlier than other animals such as the horse or cheetah. Now imagine that! There was clearly no competition there, though maybe these other ''faster'' animals may have bragged in front of tortoises and other ''slower'' animals, it says nowhere in scripture that the slower animals were closed out. Prophet Victor Boateng, of Zimbabwe, says, "...Many are times you don''t understand why God should give the horse seven days and give the tortoise seven days. But He that said seven days to the horse and said seven days to the tortoise knows how to bring the horse and the tortoise into the ark by the seventh day." I recently heard someone, in fact, Dr. Myles Munroe say, in one of his video-teaching messages on ''The Spirit of Leadership'', "observe nature itself... Nature has a rhythm about it; it is slow yet powerful. And so is God - God is still." (that''s just a paraphrase!) Some of you may be having the strength of a tortoise today and you wonder if you''ll ever make it and walk in your high places - where the LORD is calling you. But even the tortoise told himself that "He who said seven days knew how I would get to the ark. I don''t care how slow I am, but I believe I''m making progress. I don''t care what you think of me, but I too can make it despite my trying circumstances. I know where I''m going, God has told me; I will come in safely to that place!

I watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows yesterday, and saw precisely how things multiplied as they touched each one of the objects they did when they were in that room they were not allowed to touch anything [for it would multiply].

Everything around u suffer along with you.\r\n2) Your health is at risk. Your mind affects your body. Doctors say bitterness generates chemicals that affect your vital organs. They increase your heart rate, raise your blood pressure, disrupt your digestion, tense your muscles, dump cholesterol into your bloodstream, and reduce your ability to think clearly. Each time you rehearse the past those bad feelings deliver more corrosive chemicals. Science is now confirming God''s words that those who don''t forgive themselves, and others, are more prone to heart attacks, depression, hypertension and other serious illnesses.\r\n3) Your future is at risk. The Bible says, ''You will again have compassion on us... you will...hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea'' (Micah 7:19 NIV). Stop dredging up what God has buried. Start looking ahead; otherwise you''ll get mired in a bog of your own making.

He has showered his kindness on us, along with all wisdom and understanding'' (Ephesians 1:7-8 NLT).\r\nWith God''s forgiveness comes the wisdom to not only survive your past, but grow stronger as a result of it.\r\nClose every door that da enemy uses to remind u of ur past, ur free and forgiven and the past is buried.', 'Father thank u for the grace of forgiveness, for sending ur only begotten son to died for us, indeed we are free and our sins hav been forgiven.

The Bible uses the terms to “believe in” and to “believe on.” To believe on connotes TRUST. To believe in simply agrees that something is.\r\n\r\nThe greatest challenge to man receiving from God or being what God has ordained them to be is not the inability of God to do what he says, but rather the inability of man to believe in him and in his WORD.\r\n\r\nIn Philippians 4:13 Paul wrote “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”\r\n\r\nThere is a song (circular) that I use to hear which says “I believe I can fly, I believe I can touch the sky.” While this song might be a circular song, there is some biblical truth.

If you believe you can touch the sky, you will.\r\n\r\nWhen you believe impossibility is not part of your vocabulary. When you believe you do not take NO for an answer.

Listen to Christ''s words: ''If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you'' (Matthew 6:14 NKJV). Charles Spurgeon said, ''When you bury a mad dog don''t leave his tail above the ground.'' So forgive, bury it and move on. 2) Deal with the roots of your anger. Sometimes the source of our anger is hidden from us; we are ''acting out'' the unresolved hurts within us. Exaggerated anger is often displaced anger. Instead of dealing with the person who hurt us, we vent our wrath on those closest to us. Ask God to show you where the real issue lies, then deal with it. 3) Take back your power.

He was seventy-five when God promised Him a son.\r\n\r\nI wonder how many of us would believe God and live in expectation for twenty-five years. Most of us probably would have said, "I didn''t really hear from God." "Oh, I guess maybe God didn''t really mean that." Or "I need to go somewhere else to get a fresh word from the Lord."\r\n\r\nIn our impatience, we often take matters into our own hands. I say we get "bright ideas"--plans of our own, which we hope God will bless. These plans open the door for confusion and chaos. Then their results must be dealt with, which often delays our miracle.\r\n\r\nThe Bible gives us promises, hope, and encouragement. God promises good to those of us who serve Him. Despite the adversity of our circumstances--and some people have absolutely terrible situations--God still promises good. Our sense of goodness, however, may not be the same as God''s. Getting what we want immediately may not be best for us. Sometimes waiting is the best thing because it helps develop the character of God in us.\r\n\r\nThe Lord chooses to do good to us and to make us happy; the devil chooses to do wrong and to make us miserable. We can remain patient and keep believing God''s promises, or we can allow the evil one''s whisper to fill our ears and lead us astray.\r\n\r\nPositive belief in God''s promises yields good results because the Good One sends them to us.

If you follow that negative feeling, you will be walking in the flesh, and the bible says we cannot please God in the flesh. So it is not wrong to feel as if God is not working in your life, it only becomes wrong when you begin to follow that feeling.

So Peter got out of the boat and started walking on the water to Jesus.', 'NLT - Standard Version', 'In the book of Matthew chapter 14, we read of an incident where Jesus made His disciples go ahead of Him to the other side of the lake. On their way to the other side of the lake, they were confronted by heavy waves as they were in the boat. There was a heavy wind blowing against them and it tossed the boat around. Between 3 & 6 o''clock in the morning, Jesus came to them walking on the water. When they saw Him they were terrified thinking it was a ghost; and Jesus told them not to be afraid because it was Him. Peter then said, "Lord, if it is really you, order me to come out on the water to you." Let''s put our attention on Peter''s faith! Now, I know that many people like focusing on the part where Peter started sinking; But today I want us to focus on the fact that he walked on the water. Let''s look at 2 factors on how it became possible for Peter to start walking on the water. Number 1: Peter believed that he could do what Jesus could do. The bible says in 1 John 4:17, "As He is, so are we in this world." Being exactly like Jesus means that we can do what He did; It means we posses His exact life! Possessing the life of Jesus means that you can walk in miracles just as Jesus walked in miracles. So Peter had the very same kind of mentality (faith), that if He can do it, then I should also be able to do it. Keep this in mind: It was not Jesus who presented the invitation to Peter, it was Peter who asked for the offer! Peter said, "Lord if it is really you..." This statement shows us that Peter just needed a place where he could place his faith. Immediately when Jesus said, "It is I", Peter then got a place where he could lay his faith. So, just like Peter, place your faith in Jesus and you will be able to do great things which no one can explain how they happened. Number 2: Immediately when Jesus said "Come", Peter got out of the boat! Let''s put out attention on this line, "Peter got out of the boat". It''s not only enough to believe, but you need to act upon the Word you believe. This is faith: acting on the Word of God! James 2:26 says "As the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without actions is dead." Peter was able to walk on water because he acted on Jesus'' Word - "Come!" You need to take a step and come out of your boat. Pastor, what is my boat? Your boat is that comfort zone you are in. Take a step and begin a project even though you don''t know how you will finish it! Take a step and do something beyond your human ability! That day, all the disciples could have known how it feels like to walk on water, but it was only Peter who got that experience. Why was it only Peter? Because he got out of the boat! Come out of the boat!!!', 'In the Name of Jesus, I''m coming out of the boat. I''m walking on the water! I''m tapping into a faith based lifestyle! I''m beginning to act on the Word I have received!

Whatever your barrier is, you need to identify it before you can move forward. In Geesis 24, Eliezer had a number of barrars to his goal of finding a wife for Isaac. He had to figure out how to get to a country he had never been to, then he had to find the right woman he''d never met. And then he had to convince her to go back with him to a country she''d never been to and marry a complete stranger. Oh, and he had to convince her parents to let her go!

I am not referring to your physical heart which pumps lifeblood into your veins. I am talking about that invisible heart we refer to when we describe the center of our feelings, values, and character. Do you think you have a good heart, a kind heart? I thought my heart was okay until I read this startling passage in Jeremiah 17:19, “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?” Another version says the heart is “beyond cure.” Wow, heavy words! Doesn’t that prick your pride? Desperately sick? Hey, I have my off moments but I can’t be that bad. \r\n\r\nBut the more I read the Bible, the more I realize what the verse is saying. It is about the natural condition of our hearts. Take a look at little children. We don’t have to teach them to fight with their playmates, throw tantrums, break things, or grab toys from their little sister. But we have to teach them to behave, listen to daddy, give, forgive, be nice to other kids. Without discipline and instruction, we will have runaway brats and anarchy. It is in our nature to be selfish, proud, jealous, or angry. Look at the world. It is overrun by crime, lust, wars, corruption, and greed. It all begins in the human heart. Romans 3:23 says, “For all men have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” \r\n\r\nBut God so loves us that He sent His one and only Son to be our Savior, our donor to give us a heart transplant. Jesus took our hard, sinful hearts on the Cross, endured our punishment and pain, and suffered cardiac arrest in our place. But He rose again to offer us a new life and heart--His own gentle, gracious heart, able to love God and others. \r\n\r\nGod says in Ezekiel 36:26, “I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you your heart of flesh.”', '“Lord Jesus, forgive me. I surrender my life to you. Take away my sick, sinful heart and give me your good, pure and loving heart.

He took ten of Abraham''s camels with him, loaded with samples of the best of everything Abraham owned. He journeyed to Nahor and then made the camels kneel down outside the town beside a well. Eliezer then prayed, "O Lord, God of my master, Abraham, this is my request. When a young woman comes to draw water, I will say to her, "Please give me a little drink of water from your jug.'' If she says, "Yes, have a drink, and I will draw water for your camels too,'' let her be the one you have selected to be the wife of my master''s son." (Genesis 24:42-44 NLT) Now this was a big deal because camels can drink a lot of water. So that meant the woman would have to draw 20, 30, maybe 40 buckets of water. That''s a serious commitment. And that''s the kind of woman Eliezer was looking for - a woman who was kind, generous, had a servant''s heart, was willing to help someone in need and would go the extra mile. And you know what? His plan worked. A woman named Rebekah offered Eliezer a drink of water and then she offered to water his camels also. Ask yourself two questions: 1) How do I intend to get there once I know what my goal is? 2) How long will it take? You can either drift through life or you can be directed through life by taking the time to think through where God wants you to be. Is your future worth the effort?

In the Scripture we read today in the book of Ezekiel 12 (from verse 21 to 28), we learn how the people of God (the children of Israel) had a certain proverb in the land that said: "The days go by and every vision comes to nothing" -- and they actually believed it! But the Sovereign Lord rejects and denounces that proverb, and says to the people, as an introduction of a new proverb: "The days are near when every vision will be fulfilled." Oh Lord. Hallelujah! Now, as if it was not enough what the Sovereign Lord said there, He goes to say "without delay, my words will be fulfilled". Ezekiel 12:27 is very interesting.

Sometimes what looks like a disaster in your life is part of a much bigger plan.But you will never fulfill your destiny if you are having a pity party. Esther could have just said, "If only I hadn''t been chosen, if only I hadn''t been Jewish, if only I was like someone else." A lot of people do that. They live their lives in resentment, always looking at people and saying, "Well, it must be nice to be them." If you have that attitude you will never fulfill your destiny. You have to realize that the unpleasant obstacles are often God-ordained opportunities to make a difference. You might be in a situation right now where everything is going wrong and you can''t figure it out. But God knows. Nothing in your life is accidental. The pleasures and pains, the opportunities and obstacles, God can use it all. There is nothing God cannot use for good in your life if you''ll hand it over to him - and then trust him. <Rick Warren''s Daily Devotional.>', 'Heavenly Father stretch me now out of my comfortable place of conformity and mediocrity.

So the name of Jesus has been given more authority. Jesus said that whatever we shall ask in His name, it shall be done by the Father. The name of Jesus is an instrument which we can use to do anything which is in line with God''s Word! We don''t even have to pray and say "in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit". No, we don''t even have to pray in this manner! The whole of trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) is now infused into the name of Jesus; The name of Jesus carries the fullness of God in it; Therefore, the name of Jesus is an instrument which we can use at any time to change situations, to bring healing, to achieve our personal goals and dreams, and many more!

The head is the most important part of the human body. When applying for a visa or passport, you will be required to provide a passport picture of the head. Why? It is because they know that if they amputate a man’s leg, he can still live; if his two hands are amputated, he can still survive but once the head is cut off that is the end. Not only that, the only part of the human body that cannot be transplanted is the head! So when the Lord promises to make you the head, what it means is you will be the most important person around. What it simply means is you will become indispensible. It also means you will be at the top at all times. You will be so important that the strong and mighty will be coming to you for counseling. Jesus Christ is the head of the church, Ephesians 5:23. The tail on the other hand is so useless, the Lord did not even bother giving it to man. The head is the fellow in charge; the leader; the captain.\r\n\r\nThe head carries a lot of responsibilities. It is true that the head is the most important part of the body but do you also know that it is only the head that suffers headache? When everything is running smoothly, the whole body takes the glory but when things go bad the head is held accountable. Take for instance a football team. When the team wins matches and qualifies for major competitions, the whole team gets the praise but when they fail to qualify or win trophies, the manager (the head) gets the blame and loses his jobs. Anywhere you go to in the world, the head always gets blamed when things go wrong, be it in the church, family, at work, in the country. Even when the head is not aware of what is happening in the body, he gets the blame for anything that goes wrong. David and his men had just come back from war when they found out that the Amalekites had invaded and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire, 1 Samuel 30:1-8. The Amalekites took everyone in Ziklag as captives and went their way. When the men of David saw this, they became angry and began to contemplate stoning David their leader. David was in no way responsible for what the Amalekites had done; besides he lost his family just like everyone else but because he was the head they blamed him for the actions of the Amalekites. Whilst in Rephidim, the children of Israel thirsted but there was no water to drink so they began to blame their head- Moses, Exodus 17:1-7. When Moses could not find water they said he was doing it on purpose just to kill them and their children in the desert. It got a point they began to contemplate killing him. Moses too had no water to drink but because he was the leader, the children of Israel held him accountable for the lack of water. Thank God there is someone called the Burden-Bearer. When the men of David contemplated stoning him, David ran to God –the Burden Bearer. Also when things began to get out of hand, Moses too ran to God. No matter what challenges you may face at the top, there is a Burden- Bearer who you can call on and He will assist you.', 'Father, please bear my burdens for me.', '2013-02-23 15:32:29'),

We also mentioned that the head carries a lot of responsibilities. The head bears heavy responsibilities because inside the head is an organ called the brain. The only part of the body that does not rest is the brain. While the hands are folded and the legs are crossed, the brain is busy at work. To be the head means I will be hard working. When you say I shall be head, what you are saying is whilst others are busy wasting time I will be busy working. Proverbs 12:24 says the hands of the diligent will rule but the lazy man will be put to forced labor. Been the head simply means I will make good use of my time. It means I will be the first to get to the organization, school or business and the last to leave. It means I will get to church before everyone. I shall be head also means while people are sleeping at night, I will be busy watching in prayers.\r\n\r\nThe brain is the seat of wisdom, knowledge and understanding. The brain is responsible for making decisions. To make wise ecisions, wisdom is required. Proverbs 4:7 says wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. Ecclesiastes 10:10 says but wisdom is profitable to direct. Ecclesiastes 7:19 says wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten rulers of the city. Been the head means i will make wise decisions because the head gets the blame for every wrong decision. One of the reasons why the head gets blamed for whatever goes wrong is because the head controls the body. It is the brain that tells the body to carry out actions. Where does the brain gets its wisdom from? Psalm 111:10 says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. If there is a fellow who does not fear the Lord, something is wrong with the fellow’s brain. To make wise decisions, one needs to have the fear of the Lord in his heart. Proverbs 8:13 says the fear of the Lord is to hate evil. Proverbs 10:27 says the fear of the Lord prolongs days. Proverbs 14:2 says he who walks in his uprightness fears the Lord, but he who is perverse in his ways despises Him. To be head means I will fear the Lord.\r\nKEY WORD: I shall be the head simply means I will be hard working.

God calls everybody to use the gifts and the passion that they have, but not everyone picks the phone. The only way you''re going to hear is if you listen.  You''ve got to be quite, you''ve got to get alone and spend time with God. When Mordecai sends Esther word that the Jews are going to be annihilated, he essentially says, "Don''t think that you can just ignore this disturbing trend. Yeah, I know it''s been tough, but this is your destiny. God put you here. It''s no accident that you are a Jewish girl and now the queen of Persia." It''s important to read on and see Esther''s response to Mordecai in Esther 4:15, "Go, gather all the Jews and fast for me. I and my maids will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law" (NIV). Esther knows confronting the king is likely to mean certain death. She''s going to have to use her gifts of beauty, brains, and personality to persuade him. But before she goes to see him, she sets aside three days to fast and pray before God. When you''re seeking God''s call on your life, follow Esther''s example. First, get all the support you can. Second, you need extended time with alone with God.

Amen. If I had a privilege to rename the theme of this devotion, I would definitely rename it "Christ Is All, and Is In All!" The reason is quite simple and very clear. Our study text will be from the book of John:9-11 (the famous John 10!) In the reading of text, Jesus refers to two particular things in context: 1) The gate, and 2) the good shepherd. In this allegory, without overlooking other variables such as thieves and robbers (and killers), he [Jesus] first mentions the gate and in verse 9 he says what is very profound indeed, "I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved (or kept safe). They will come in and go out, and find pasture." After verse 9, we read verse 10, which basically tells us about the devil - how comes only steal and kill and destroy, we can skip that and go straight to the following verse. In verse 11, Jesus now reveals himself as the good shepherd... So both of these things in context are referring to him.  I said, "Christ Is All, and Is In All!" He''s the gate we go in through and even The One who leads us into it! Imagine this. Jesus is the gate and the good shepherd. Christ is all, and is in all. From the beginning to the end. Nothing exists without him. He holds all things together. He is the source of all existence. Everybody needs this saving truth that Jesus is the way that goes to the Father; he is the gate (or door) that entereth therein; and he is the good shepherd in whom is all the truth. Amen', 'Heavenly Father, Christ is all, and is in all of us. By your saving grace, may we extend the reality of this truth and good tidings unto others that have not even yet realized the reality of this that Jesus is the way, the faithful shepherd and the gate that entereth therein heaven.

It''s not enough to just talk about your calling and set some goals. You need to decide to go for it, to say "I''m going to do is." Esther knew going to the king was risky and it could lead to her death. She was afraid to to go, but she it was the right thing to do. And she said, "If I perish, I perish." That''s a faith commitment. Until you know what you are willing to die for, you are not ready to live. You just are just existing. But when you understand your destiny and you know what God has called you to do, you''re willing to go for it. You''re willing to abandon everything. Knowing what God has called you to do and making the faith commitment to do it means setting goals. The best way I can put it is this: You can only manage what you measure. This is an important principle of life. If you don''t have specific goals that can be measured, your goal will just be a pipe dream. You won''t be any better, you won''t be any better, you won''t be any different than you are today. And above all else, make sure you set goals with faith. Why? Because Jesus said, "Because of your faith, it will happen." (Matthew 9:29 NLT)', 'Heavenly Father, may I learn today to express faith with my goals, and may this be a complete turn around in my life today so I may walk in purpose...

All we have to do is to walk into all the promises of God, because when we walk in those promises God is glorified. Walking in the promises of God means that our conduct, our attitude towards life, our actions and even the words we say must correspond with the fulfilled promises of God. A promise from God is not like a promise from a human being. When a human being makes a promise to you, the promise is under the chances of being cancelled or postponed; But this is totally different with God. When God makes a promise, the promise is fulfilled already. This means that when God makes a promise, it is now up to me whether I experience the fulfillment of the promise or not. God''s promises are divine. In each and every day of your life, you have to make a choice of living and walking in the promises of God. Again I repeat, God''s promises are divine; if you don''t believe them you cannot experience their fulfillment.

The only method which Jesus has given us for dealing with our haters is praying for them. Praying for your enemies is the only way which God permits for dealing with them. You see, God Himself is Love; And remember we are born of Him; This means that the very same Love which God operates in, should be the one we also operate in. According to God''s way of doing things, He expects us to do what He does. God loved us before we could love Him, that is the reason why He expects us to love those who hate us or do bad to us. Therefore, we ought not to take revenge, instead we should pray for all those who are against us; We should look at them with eyes of Love and wish them well in their lives!', 'Dear Father, as I am born of you; Please guide me into walking and functioning in Love.

This is your destiny. God announced this intention at Creation: "Then God said, "Let us make human beings in our image and likeness." (Genesis 1:26 NCV) In all of creation, only human beings are made in "God''s image". This is a great privilege and gives us dignity. We don''t know all this phrase covers, but we do know some of the aspects of it includes - we are spiritual beings - our spirits are immortal and will outlast our earthly bodies; we are intellectual - we can think, reason, and solve problems; we  are relational - we can give and receive real love; and we have a moral consciousness -we can discern right from wrong, which makes us accountable to God. But the image is incomplete and has been damaged and distorted by sin. So God sent Jesus on a mission to restore the full image that we have lost. What does the full "image and likeness" of God look like? It looks like Jesus Christ!

The average European saves 18%. Yet, last year Americans spent 1% more than they made. Many people in retirement are going to be dirt poor because they didn''t start saving early enough; they didn''t practice the principle of investing in the future.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a question you can ask yourself that will help you save more money. It''s real simple. When you get ready to buy something ask yourself, "Do I really need this?" And then be honest enough to tell yourself.\r\n\r\nFor instance, do I really need a new car? Well, I know I''d like it. But, do I really need a new car? Do I really need this upgrade?

When you''re around them you feel slightly off balance because you don''t know what to expect next. Over time you realise that their ideas and actions can be trusted. Why? Because they have a spiritual root system that goes down to streams of living water. Consequently, what they put their hand to ''prospers.'' And you can live this way. How? By setting your spiritual priorities in concrete. The arch enemy of spiritual growth is busyness, which is closely tied to something the Bible calls ''worldliness'' - getting caught up with society''s agenda to the neglect of walking with God.

The Lord made coats of skin for them to cover their nakedness. Let us briefly focus on what type of clothes was made for them. The bible records that He made coats of skin or tunic for them. There are three things about these coats of skin or tunic. Firstly, it was not transparent; secondly, it was not tight or it did not reveal their body shape; thirdly and most importantly it covered their nakedness. The fashion world advises otherwise but the reason why God created clothe for man was to cover his nakedness. Bible scholars have actually pointed out that the coat was from their shoulder to their ankle. This is the first occasion in the bible we see God giving humans a dress code. As a child of God, whatever we wear must satisfy at least these three: 1- not transparent; 2- not tight fitting or expose body shape & 3- must cover our nakedness.\r\n\r\nGod is not only interested in covering our physical nakedness but our spiritual nakedness too. The danger of been spiritually naked is that it exposes one to attack. Ephesians 6:12 says we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. The question is what is our spiritual dress code? Ephesians 6:11 says put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. According to Ephesians 6:14, we should gird our waist with truth and put on a breastplate of righteousness. John 4:24 says God is a Spirit; and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. 2 Corinthians 6:4-7 says but in all things approving yourself as minister of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and left. Ephesians 6:15 says we should shod our feet in peace. James 3:16-18 says where envying and strife (opposite of peace), there is confusion and every evil work. Ephesians 6:16 says our shield should be of faith. The moment our faith weaver Satan wins. Ephesians 6:17 says our helmet should be a helmet of salvation and our weapon which is the sword – a sword of the spirit which is the word of God. The bible records in Matthew 8:16 that Jesus casted out the spirits with His words. To be fully clothed spiritually one need to put on the whole armour of God. Any fellow studying the word of God but not living in peace is spiritually naked because he is not putting on the whole armour of God. Putting on the helmet of salvation without the breastplate of righteousness is as good as naked. This is why we need to give our lives to Christ; live a life of righteousness; live in peace with everyone; study the bible regularly; build our faith by hearing by the word of God e.t.c.

The truth is, your body was not designed for inactivity. God created you to be active. Even a daily walk will make a difference in your physical well-being and your spiritual well-being.\r\n\r\nOne thing I have noticed is that most of us are convinced but not committed. We know that exercise is good for us. We are convinced of that, but that doesn''t mean we are committed to exercise.\r\n\r\nWhat is the common excuse? "I don''t have the time.''\r\n\r\nLet me ask, do you have time to be sick? If you don''t make time for exercise, you''ll probably be forced to make time for an illness. Is that how you want to spend your time?\r\n\r\nWhat is the common mistake? We overdo it at the start. We''ve been looking at how physical health will help us reach our destiny during the next decade. Some of you might have already said, "I''m going to get in shape if it kills me!"\r\n\r\nWe have the philosophy that if something is good, then more is better. We''ve been out of shape for several years, but then we try to get in shape in one week! And so we work ourselves to death, get totally exhausted and, as a result, we wear out quickly and give up.\r\n\r\nThe key is training not straining. If you want to get in shape fast, exercise longer, not harder. And that will help you stay committed to a consistent, regular exercise program. (Rick Warren''s Daily Devotional)', 'Dear Father, I pray for the proper maintenance and health of my body, which is Your temple, today, in Jesus Name. Amen', '2013-04-09 00:01:37'),

And I want to stress one more time that unrelenting stress harms our bodies.\r\n\r\nWhy do we wait until our health plummets before we decide to create margin in our lives? The Bible teaches that your body needs downtime in order to heal and re-energize.\r\n\r\nListen to why this is so important: when you''re overloaded by activity, you can only think of yourself. You''re in survival mode, just trying to make it through another day. And that limits your usefulness in ministry!\r\n\r\nWhen you have no downtime or margin in your life and God taps you on the shoulder, saying, "I''d like you to do this for me," your first response isn''t joy. Your first response is, "Oh, no! Another thing to do! Sorry, God -- I''d like to do that, but I''m just too busy."\r\n\r\nWe end up resenting the great opportunities God brings into our lives. But when we deliberately and specifically add downtime into our lives, we become available for God to use us as we head into this decade of destiny.\r\n\r\nYou don''t have to live on overload. You don''t have to live in survival mode. Begin today to build a buffer around your schedule. Then enjoy the benefits of margin -- and see what God does next! (Rick Warren''s Daily Devotional)', 'Dear Father, I have been learning about the body and the importance therefore to look after and maintain it as is Your temple.

You cannot be successful in your Christian life without the knowledge of God''s Word. Knowledge of the Word increases your strength. Many Christians find Christianity to be a difficult thing, this is simply because they do not have the knowledge of what Christ Jesus has done for them at the cross. When you lack knowledge, the devil will take advantage of you because you do not have the knowledge of your identity in Christ! How do I grow in my knowledge of God''s Word? The only way to grow in your knowledge of God''s Word, is to abide in the Word. Don''t just read the bible as if you are reading a magazine, read the bible and then think deeply upon what you have read (meditate); As you think deeply upon what you have read, the Word will then be transported to your Spirit and the Word will be rooted into your Spirit as Rhema (the spoken Word of God).', 'I abide in God''s Word; In every day of my life I hunger and I thirst for God''s Word.', '2013-04-09 12:10:59'),

But, he had many obstacles coming against the promise of God in his life. God told him that he would be “the father of many nations.” Abraham was over 90 years old before he ever saw that promise begin to come to pass. This scripture tells us that He didn’t consider his body. He didn’t think and meditate on all the reasons he couldn’t be the father of many nations. No, he considered and thought about the strength and ability of God! He thought about God’s faithfulness and gave praise and glory to Him! The faith that Abraham exercised enabled God to move on His behalf and fulfill the promise in His life.\r\nToday, what are you believing God for? Does it seem impossible? Has it taken a long time? Consider your God. Consider His Word. Consider His faithfulness. Just like Abraham, you’ll grow strong in faith as you give glory to God. Your faith will open the door for God to move in your life, and you will experience the victory and breakthrough He has in store for you!', 'Heavenly Father, thank You for Your faithfulness and strength at work in my life today.

(Colossians 3:23 NLT) It''s easier to be enthusiastic about your job when you turn the focus of your work from "I''m doing this for my boss" or "I''m doing this for a paycheck" to "I''m doing this for the Lord," With that in mind you can do anything - scrape paint, wash dishes, repair a car - and turn it into worship.\r\n\r\nSecond, when you turn your work into worship, you start storing up credits in heaven. Colossians 3:24 says, "Remember that the Lord will give you an inheritance as your reward, and the Master you are serving is Christ." (Colossians 3:24 NLT) As you work for God, you are making eternal deposits in heaven.\r\n\r\n"So whatever you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God." (1 Corinthians 10:31 NIV) It doesn''t matter if you''re rearranging papers or signing bills, any job can become an act of worship if you do it enthusiastically for God. (Rick Warren''s Daily Devotional)', 'CONFESSION: My work is the reflection of God''s glory. Because I am where I am today, it''s because of His grace and power. This is my ''Thank You'' to Him when I work as though unto Him, and labour in the faith that my reward is the inheritance in Heavenly places.

(548, '', 38, 'You Won''t Take Your Job to Heaven', 'Romans 5:3', '"And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience."', 'King James Version', 'You''re not taking your job to heaven. You''re not taking some gold watch or achievement award to heaven. You''re taking YOU, so you want to build character because God is more interested in what you become rather than what you do.\r\n\r\nLook again at today''s verse because some people have a misunderstanding about temptation. They think that, once they become a Christian, they should be beyond temptation.\r\n\r\nIt''s important to realize you will never outgrow temptation. In fact, the closer you are to God, the more you become an enemy of Satan, and the more he will try to tempt you. The good news is that God gives you greater strength to resist it.\r\n\r\nWhen you are tempted at work - to be unkind, to get angry, to be prideful or greedy - remember that every temptation is not only an opportunity to do good but, it''s also an opportunity to grow in character.\r\n\r\nFor example, when you encounter an annoying co-worker, the temptation may be for you to get upset with that person. But the Bible says to bless those who curse you and pray for those who offend you. So instead of getting mad, use it as an opportunity to praise God.\r\n\r\nFirst, Satan will get annoyed that you''re praising God. The more you praise God, the less Satan will use that as a temptation in your life.\r\n\r\nSecond, you''ll find yourself naturally growing in godly character as you apply God''s Word to your life. (Rick Warren''s Daily Devotional)', 'CONFESSIONS: My studies, my job, my ministry, my business, my leadership position(s), my eating and drinking, my waking-up and sleeping, all of these (and possibly more) become an act of worship to God, the Father.

Our hope in Christ is not just for here and now, but it is also a hope that transcends life and bursts the shackles of death. If it doesn''t offer us this hope, then it is no hope at all; it is not really good news. We are deluded and to be pitied. But then, I do believe! That, my friend, changes everything!', 'Father God, the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, I believe that your victory over death in Jesus'' resurrection also means my victory over death!

Even when they are irritable, even when they don''t like you, even when they make fun of you, even when they put you down for being a Christian, you must still be a friend to them.\r\n\r\nWhy is this so important for success? Because the number one lesson in life, the number one reason God put you on this earth, is to learn how to love. God is love and he wants you to be like him.\r\n\r\nIt''s easy to love people you like, the people you find easy to get along with. So if God''s going to teach you real love, realize that he''s going to put you around unlovely people.\r\n\r\n"Everything you do must be done with love" - This means at the office, in the car, on a sales trip, whatever. The good news is this really is not hard. It''s easy to underestimate the power of a kind word, a friendly smile, a pat on the back, a genuine compliment, a word of encouragement, and a listening ear.\r\n\r\nI have seen so many lives changed when somebody takes time to pay attention to them. There is not a person on this planet who isn''t starving for attention. But a caring person is hard to find.\r\n\r\nThe Apostle Paul said this, "I have no one else like Timothy, who genuinely cares about your welfare." (Philippians 2:20 NLT) Does that sound like your workplace? Everyone looking out for his own interests, not those of Jesus Christ? Those who really care are really aware. (Rick Warren''s Daily Devotional)', 'Dear Heavenly Father, today I pray for the love of God to surround me, as I come and as I go.

Child of the King; You need not worry about any of this! All thanks to God for the Blessing of forgiveness. God''s forgiveness is our model because it is complete. When we confess and repent of our sins, He forgives us. He will never throw those sins back at us. He forgives and forgets! That''s the model for our relationships. "Forgive and Forget." It''s a blessing to be forgiven and have a relationship restored. It''s also a blessing to be the one who does the forgiving. Be as willing to be the forgiver as the one forgiven, because God is always willing to forgive us and have our relationship with Him restored!', 'Dear Father, I''m so thankful for your forgiveness, probably because I need it so often.

When you lose control you risk losing other things as well, like the respect of others or the chance to find a constructive solution. Anger toward human suffering is not only appropriate; it''s the catalyst for change. Paul writes, ''...Be angry...but...don''t stay angry...'' (Ephesians 4:26 TM). The Chinese have a saying: ''Anger is the wind that blows out the lamp of the mind.'' So:1) Before you react, take a walk. It burns off excess adrenaline and it''s more effective than stewing. It also helps you to think more clearly and handle things in a way you won''t regret. ''A quick-tempered man does foolish things...'' (Proverbs 14:17 NIV).2) Recognise the things you can''t control. You can''t control other people''s attitudes and actions, or unforeseen events such as cancelled flights and traffic jams. ''What should I do?'' you ask. Count your blessings, particularly the fact that you have God, salvation, your health, your family, your job, and a car to get to it, etc.3) Be careful where you vent. It''s one thing to be angry; it''s another to ''sound off'' at the wrong time. ''A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards'' (Proverbs 29:11 KJV). It''s okay to share your feelings with those you trust and who are not the targets of your anger. But be careful, your words can come back and bite you!4) Keep your distance from angry people.

We view obedience as a forced, unwilling decision to do something we don''t want to do because we''re afraid of punishment.\r\n\r\nBut that''s not the kind of obedience that''s in God''s Word. Obedience in the Bible means this: love + trust + action.\r\n\r\nIt starts with love, as Jesus said in John 14:15, "If you love me, you will obey what I command." (NIV) Obedience comes from knowing that God loves you and you love him in return.\r\n\r\nA lot of people think obedience is about fearing God, but God wants us to see obedience to him as a relationship of love. And out of love comes trust (and, of course, fearing God). If you trust what God is saying to you, and you believe that he loves you, then that will lead to action.\r\n\r\nYou need to have all three because action without love is just rote religion. And love without action is just mere talk.

I''ve had the opportunity to meet a lot of great men and women of faith from around the world. They''re all different from each other, but they all have one thing in common. When they sense God saying to do something, they don''t hesitate. They step out and do it.\r\n\r\nFirst John 5:3 says, "This is love for God, to obey his commands. And his commands are not burdensome." (NIV) I was talking recently with Tom Holladay, my brother-in-law, about why, when God asks you to do something, it sometimes feels like a burden. What''s wrong? We decided it''s often because of procrastination. When we don''t act right away, it becomes harder to do the longer we wait. But when we do what God says, freedom comes into our lives.\r\n\r\nWhat is God calling you to do? Is it a phone call you need to make? An action you need to take?

Every parent knows that delayed obedience is really disobedience.\r\n\r\nGod doesn''t owe you an explanation or reason for everything he asks you to do. Understanding can wait, but obedience can''t. Instant obedience will teach you more about God than a lifetime of Bible discussions. In fact, you will never understand some commands until you obey them first. Obedience unlocks understanding.\r\n\r\nOften we try to offer God partial obedience. We want to pick and choose the commands we obey. "I''ll attend church but I won''t tithe.'' "I''ll read my Bible but won''t forgive the person who hurt me.''\r\n\r\nWholehearted obedience is done joyfully, with enthusiasm. The Bible says, "Obey him gladly." (Psalm 100:2 LB)\r\n\r\nThis is the attitude of David: "Just tell me what to do and I will do it, Lord. As long as I live I''ll wholeheartedly obey." (Psalm 119:33 LB)\r\n\r\nJames, speaking to Christians, said, "We please God by what we do and not only by what we believe." (James 2:24 CEV)\r\n\r\nGod''s Word is clear that you can''t earn your salvation. It comes only by grace, not your effort. But as a child of God you can bring pleasure to your heavenly Father through obedience. Any act of obedience is also an act of worship.\r\n\r\nWhy is obedience so pleasing to God? Because it proves you really love him. Jesus said, "If you love me, you will obey my commandments."

(1 John 4:16 NIV)\r\n\r\nWhen you realize how much God loves you - with an extravagant, irresistible, unconditional love - then his love will change your entire focus on life. If we don''t receive God''s love for us, we''ll have a hard time loving other people. I''m talking about loving the unlovely, loving the difficult, loving the irritable, loving people who are different or demanding.\r\n\r\nYou can''t do that until you have God''s love coming through you. You need to know God''s love so it can overflow out of your life into others.

The Bible knows nothing of solitary saints or spiritual hermits.\r\n\r\nWhile your relationship to Christ is personal, God never intends it to be private. In God''s family you are connected to every other believer. The Bible says, "In Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others."

Lewis noted that the word "membership'' is of Christian origin, but the world has emptied it of its original meaning.

In churches, membership is often reduced to simply adding your name to a roll, with no requirements or expectations.\r\n\r\nTo Paul, being a "member'' of the church meant being a vital organ of a living body, an indispensable, interconnected part of the Body of Christ.

You discover your role in life through your relationships with others.\r\n\r\nThe Bible tells us, "Each part gets its meaning from the body as a whole, not the other way around. The body we''re talking about is Christ''s body of chosen people. Each of us finds our meaning and function as a part of his body. But as a chopped-off finger or cut-off toe we wouldn''t amount to much, would we?" (Romans 12:4-5 MSG)\r\n\r\nIf an organ is somehow severed from its body, it will shrivel and die. It cannot exist on its own, and neither can you. Disconnected and cut off from the lifeblood of a local body, your spiritual life will wither and eventually cease to exist. (Ephesians 4:16)\r\n\r\nThis is why the first symptom of spiritual decline is usually inconsistent attendance at worship services and other gatherings of believers. Whenever we become careless about fellowship, everything else begins to slide, too.\r\n\r\nMembership in the family of God is neither inconsequential nor something to be casually ignored.

(615, '', 38, 'Convictions Determine Conduct', 'Genesis 1:1', '"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."', 'King James Version', 'Dictionaries usually define conviction as a fixed or strong belief. Conviction is really much more than that. Your convictions include your values, commitments, and motivations.\r\n\r\nI like the definition of conviction I once heard from the great Bible teacher Howard Hendricks: "A belief is something you will argue about. A conviction is something you will die for!"\r\n\r\nOur convictions determine our conduct. They motivate us to act in certain ways.\r\n\r\nWhen you first become a Christian you often do things simply because other Christians around you suggest them or model them. You may pray, read the Bible and attend services because you see the examples of others.\r\n\r\nThis is fine for a new Christian. Little children learn the same way. However, as you grow, you must eventually develop your own reasons for doing what you do. Those reasons become convictions.\r\n\r\nBiblical convictions are essential for spiritual growth and maturity. What is ironic today is that people often have strong convictions about weak issues (football, fashions, etc.) while having weak convictions about major issues (what is right and what is wrong).\r\n\r\nThink about your walk with Jesus and make a list of the convictions you now hold. Are your convictions weak on any major issues? (Rick Warren''s Daily Devotional)', 'Heavenly Father, we pray for relatively stronger convictions when it comes to our values, commitments and faith (as believers in Jesus Christ) because we understand that it''s these very convictions that will significantly and ultimately  determine our conduct. We have prayed in Jesus name. Amen', '2013-05-04 16:40:17'),

If you don''t determine what''s important and how you''ll live, other people will determine it for you.\r\n\r\nA person without conviction is a weak, jellyfish type of individual who mindlessly follows the crowd. I believe Paul was talking about conviction when he said in Romans 12:2, "Don''t let the world squeeze you into its own mold, but let God remold your mind from within ." (Phillips)\r\n\r\nConviction helps us be diligent in continuing to grow spiritually. Growth requires time and effort. Without convictions about growth, people become discouraged and give up. No one stays with a difficult task unless he is convinced that there is a good reason for doing it. A church can teach people how to pray, how to study the Bible, and how to witness, but without imparting the corresponding convictions, people will not stick with it.\r\n\r\nKnowing what to do (knowledge), why to do it (perspective) and how to do it (skill) is worthless if you don''t have the conviction that will motivate you to actually do it!\r\n\r\nThe people who have made the greatest impact on this world, for good or evil, were the people with the strongest, deepest convictions. They weren''t necessarily the smartest, wealthiest, or best educated people, but their convictions moved them to move the world. (Rick Warren''s Daily Devotional)', 'Heavenly Father, after learning how powerful convictions are, we make of us these convictions: Nothing will separate us from the love of Christ. We are more than conquerors. We are gods, children of the most high God. ... May you instill in us the deepest conviction of your Word and Truth in our spirits in Jesus Name we have prayed.

This produced a deep awareness of his life''s purpose and kept him from being distracted by the agenda of others. If you want to gain insight into the convictions Jesus held, just study all the times he used the phrase "I must."\r\n\r\nWhen people develop Christlike convictions, they, too, develop a sense of purpose.\r\n\r\nConviction also has an attractive quality to it. This explains the popularity of many cults. Their beliefs are erroneous and often illogical, yet they are believed with intense conviction. In contrast, churches without clear, strong convictions will never attract the level of commitment that Christ deserves.\r\n\r\nWe must burn with the conviction that the Kingdom of God is the greatest cause in the world.

About Pentecost: Throughout Jewish history, it has been customary to engage in all-night study of the Torah on the first evening of Shavuot. Children were encouraged to memorize Scripture and rewarded with treats. The book of Ruth was traditionally read during Shavuot. Today, however, many of the customs have been left behind and their significance lost. The public holiday has become more of a culinary festival of dairy dishes. Traditional Jews still light candles and recite blessings, adorn their homes and synagogues with greenery, eat dairy foods, study the Torah, read the book of Ruth and attend Shavuot services.\r\n...The book of Acts continues to record the miraculous outpouring of the Holy Spirit that began on Pentecost. Once again we see the Old Testament revealing a shadow of the things to come through Christ! After Moses went up to Mount Sinai, the Word of God was given to the Israelites at Shavuot. When the Jews accepted the Torah, they became servants of God. Similarly, after Jesus went up to heaven, the Holy Spirit was given at Pentecost. When the disciples received the gift, they became witnesses for Christ. Jews celebrated a joyous harvest on Shavuot, and the church celebrated a harvest of newborn souls on Pentecost. •Shavuot is one of the three pilgrimage feasts when all Jewish males were required to appear before the Lord in Jerusalem. •Pentecost or Shavuot has many names in the Bible (the Feast of Weeks, the Feast of Harvest, and the Latter Firstfruits). •The days is celebrated on the fiftieth day after passover.

Do not behave as the Pharisees who wear the broadest phylacteries and the longest fringes and want the front seats in synagogues and love to be greeted obsequiously in market squares, and want to be called “Rabbis” by the people. One alone is your Master: the Christ. You who in future will be the new doctors, I am referring to you, My apostles and disciples, remember that I alone am your Teacher. And I will be your only Teacher also when I am no longer among you. Because Wisdom alone teaches. So do not allow yourselves to be called teachers, because you are disciples yourselves. Do not pretend to be called fathers and do not call father anyone on the Earth, because only one is the Father of all men: your Father Who is in Heaven. May this truth make you wise by really feeling all like brothers to one another, both those who guide and those who are guided, and so love one another like good brothers. And none of those who guide must allow themselves to be called guides, because only one is your guide: the Christ.\r\n\r\nLet the greatest among you be your servant. He who is the servant of the servants of God does not humiliate himself, but he imitates Me, as I was kind and humble, always willing to love those who were My brothers in the flesh of Adam, and to assist them by means of the power that I have as God. Neither by serving men did I humiliate what is divine in Me. Because he is a true king who knows how to dominate not so much men, as the passions of men, first of all foolish pride. Remember: he who humbles himself will be exalted, and he who exalts himself will be humbled.”\r\n\r\nhttp://issuu.com/RicardoDeLeon/docs/poem_of_the_man-god_volume_5/1', 'Father, let me be as Thou will.

This activity happens on a number of levels. When a person who’s trying hard to lose weight consistently binges on pizza and ice cream, disappointment ensues. When an individual commits a crime, victims suffer and the perpetrator risks jail time. When a husband or wife chooses to engage in an extramarital affair, the marriage is damaged—sometimes beyond repair—and children suffer the consequences. When a CEO decides to overlook or sometimes even encourage accounting inconsistencies, giant corporations fail, high-level indictments follow and investors lose their savings.\r\n\r\nWhat do all of the scenarios outlined above have in common? Every one of these accounts, as well as countless other failure-filled stories, can trace its origin to the book of Genesis. Today’s reading gives us a glimpse of the first failure to follow a direct command from God and the devastating results of that failure. We see the repercussions of this disobedience reflected in the daily news—and, if we’re honest, reflected in our own darkened hearts.\r\n\r\nAt first, Adam and Eve were sure of God’s instructions. There was no doubt. They knew exactly what God wanted because they received their marching orders straight from the Creator himself. Still, a simple challenge (“Did God really say …?”) from the serpent shook Eve’s confidence to the core. Once she questioned what she knew to be true, she became vulnerable to Satan’s temptation. When she and Adam then acted in violation of God’s direct command, sin invaded what had been an unimaginably perfect paradise.\r\n\r\nSpiritually speaking, what are you sure of beyond the shadow of a doubt? What do you know to be true? Where does your certainty come from? These are important questions to answer because you face tests every day that can undermine your Biblical marching orders.

Contrary to common religious beliefs, prayer is not pleading with God or bargaining with Him to act on our behalf. Neither is it characterized by a lot of “spiritual” sounding clichés that do not line up with the Word. Prayer is simply communicating with God by speaking His Word to Him in faith. When we pray this way, results are inevitable. \r\n\r\nHebrews 4:12 clearly describes the power of that Word. It says, “For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” Verse 14 encourages believers to “hold fast to our profession.” In other words, speak God’s Word, because it is power-packed! When we pray, believing that we have already received what we are praying, God has no choice but to make our prayers come to pass. He honors His Word, not our emotions. \r\n\r\nPrayer should produce rest, or peace of mind. Many people pray fear-based prayers and hope they are getting through to God, but they really don’t have confidence in what they are praying. The Bible says that when we believe the Word, we will enter into a state of rest. The integrity of the Word speaks for itself, and will never fail. By allowing the Word to be the foundation of our prayer life, our confidence in our prayers will soar to new heights. We must know in our “knower” that Scripture is infallible, and have no doubt that what God says is true and that we already possess it. I urge you to begin to pray the solution to your problems first, rather than bombard heaven with desperate pleas. \r\n\r\nPrayer is the language through which you and the Father fellowship with one another. It is through your dialogue with Him that your faith to believe His promises through Jesus Christ will come to pass.

Fear has torment; fear is the opposite of faith. When we find ourselves in the struggles of life, we don’t give in to fear, God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of love, power and a sound mind. Don’t be discouraged, don’t get over-whelmed by life. Another thing that happens in battles is weariness. People get tired; they feel like giving up or giving in. Don’t get discouraged, don’t give up. Depression is a pressing down of emotions, in the battle let God’s Spirit lift you up. God allows the battles to come into our lives so that He might reveal His power to us. Our battles aren’t our battles at all. We must learn to release them to God; we must learn to lay things down on the altar.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe battle is the Lord’s—God doesn’t ever put us into the midst of a battle to prove our strength and power, but to reveal His. This is where faith and trust come in, we trust God, and we put our faith in His Word. Many times we try to solve all our problems, try to fix things that seemingly won’t get fixed, and spend our time and energy running out to meet every giant in our lives. God says, stand still, wait on the Lord, trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not on thy own understanding. Standing still is the hardest thing to do.\r\n\r\nGod says, nothing is hard for Me, nothing is difficult for Me, nothing is impossible for Me. For the Lord will be with you—in our battles we are never alone, we aren’t facing battles by ourselves. God is with us, He will never leave you, nor forsake you, He will go with you to the ends of the earth. Many times our battle will seem so big that we can’t see anything except the battle. But God is with us, He is God of the mountain, but God of the valley. It is in the darkest times that He reveals His brightest lights. Facing the battle, we go into the battle with praise. We worship the Lord before the battle, we worship the Lord in the battle, and we worship the Lord after the victory. Battles come to steal our faith; battles come to rob us of our joy. The joy of the Lord is our strength.\r\n\r\nToday, many of us are in struggles, battles, and many may feel hopeless or overwhelmed in the battle. Give the battle to the Lord, lay it on the altar and worship the Lord in the midst of the battle. Let faith overcome fear, and stand still and see the glory of the Lord.

We''ve all been born physically, and that event was our first birth. But the spirits that live inside our bodies needed to receive life as well. Before we were saved, we were like prisoners waiting on death row - as good as dead already. "Sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death" (James 1:15 NKJV). We needed God to pardon us and remove the death sentence. Our spirits needed to be given life. And God did this. "You...He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses" (Colossians 2:13 NKJV). Jesus said, "That which is born of flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" (John 3:6 KJV). Being born-again therefore means being "born of the Spirit." This happens when you believe in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour, and God sends the Holy Spirit into your heart. "It is the Spirit who gives life" (John 6:63 NKJV). When the Spirit of Christ enters your heart and gives you eternal life, this is called being born-again. Jesus said "again" because this is the second birth.', 'Dear Father, I thank you that I am now born of your Spirit. Thank you Father for giving me the privilege to believe in you.

Never underestimate what God can do through ordinary people and limited resources given to him in faith. If you want to be used by God just get available.\r\n\r\nHe gave God all he had - The boy gave all five loaves and both fish. He didn''t hold anything back from God.

No matter how big your problem is, God can handle it. But you must do your part. Do what you can with what you have and then expect God to take it from there.\r\n\r\nThe feeding of the 5,000 teaches a principle that''s all through the Scripture: you cannot out-give God. Whenever you give something to Him in faith, the blessing is incredible. "And the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. And the number of the men who had eaten was five thousand." (Mark 6:43-44 NIV)\r\n\r\nAny time you give sacrificially to God you always end up getting more back from Him.

They may complain. They may cut corners. But don’t sink down to their level — you are working for Almighty God. You are called to excellence! \r\nI encourage you today, stay determined. Stay focused.
