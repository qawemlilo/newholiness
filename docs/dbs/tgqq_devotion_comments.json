Арестован папа-депутат мажора, убившего человека16. 2011 12:52 Прокуратура возбудила уголовное дело против экс-депутата Симферопольского городского совета и одного из богатейших людей Крыма Иосифа Файнгольда. В субботу он был взят под стражу в одной из больниц Симферополя, куда лег в четверг в связи с ухудшением здоровья, пишет Новый регион. Как сообщил источник в окружении Файнгольда, по уголовному делу вместе с экс-депутатом горсовета проходят еще два близких ему человека. В частности, в деле фигурирует директор предприятия Автодом , которому приписывают владение парковкой и рынком около железнодорожного вокзала Симферополя. По словам источника, дело связано с работой земельной комиссии Симферопольского горсовета в бытность Файнгольда депутатом. По словам другого источника, в рамках расследования уголовного дела вчера в доме Файнгольда был проведен обыск. Пресс-службы правоохранительных органов не располагают информацией о возбуждении уголовного дела против Файнгольда. Отметим, сын Иосифа Файнгольда Виталий также является фигурантом уголовного дела. В сентябре 2008 года автомобиль Бентли Континенталь , которым руководил Файнгольд-младший, на большой скорости врезался в мотоцикл. Девушка, управлявшая мотоциклом, погибла на месте аварии. Эксперты установили, что Bentley двигался со скоростью 171 километр в час. Суд приговорил Файнгольда к трем годам лишения свободы с лишением права управлять транспортом на три года, решив при этом освободить его от наказания с испытательным сроком два года. 12 апреля 2011 года в Симферополе возобновился судебный процесс над Файнгольдом, после того как Верховный суд в начале года постановил пересмотреть приговор виновнику ДТП.

Депутат Государственной Думы Максим Коробов пошел на таран. Аккуратненько в полицейскую машину, столь не вовремя оказавшуюся на его пути, неподалеку от американского посольства. И, правильно! Почему он член парламентского комитета по транспорту должен уступать дорогу какому-то патрульному автомобилю? Гаишники (или как их сейчас называть?) совсем оборзели: гонят на честного депутата почем зря. Говорят, что именно Коробов виновник аварии, не пропустил при повороте налево Шевроле Lanos ГУВД Москвы, двигавшуюся по встречному направлению. Это сержант-водитель на него наехал в прямом смысле этого слова, и поцарапал две правые дверцы Bentley своим неуклюжим бампером. Тем самым причинив поправимый (при депутатской-то зарплате) ущерб в 70 тысяч рублей. Традиционная позиция полиции: даже будучи виноваты сами, они всегда стараются спихнуть вину на других, - заявил Максим Коробов в интервью Вестям. - Но меня не удивляет их трусливая позиция, потому что эти люди не имеют ни мужества, ни чести признавать правду и очевидное, когда они виноваты. Я конечно и до него знал, что в наших внутренних органах существуют нехорошие бациллы. Но, так, чтобы вся полиция оптом не имела ни мужества, ни чести все-таки не предполагал. Увы, плакала реформа Дмитрия Медведева с таким-то сбродом, ведь не может же наш депутат врать? Хотя, признаюсь, поначалу меня, как и героя того фильма, терзали смутные подозрения. Нет, не поводу столкновения законодательной власти с исполнительной я там не присутствовал, не знаю а по поводу наличия у честного парламентария автомобиля стоимостью в 10 млн. Даже при всех депутатских надбавках за вредность купить такую махину проблематично, особенно с учетом того, что Коробов заседает в Государственной Думе с 1999 года. Значит, по закону никаким бизнесом заниматься не мог. Копил, наверное, долгие годы, отказывая себе во всем, - решил я и ошибся. Bentley Continental подарила жена на юбилей , - не стал скрывать источник своей роскоши Максим Коробов. Судя по декларации о доходах, супруга его очень любит, по крайней мере, он имеет в собственности еще Порше Cayenne, Порше Cayenne S и мотоцикл БМВ. Дай бог всем такую половину !Вообще наши мандатники - люди отчаянные. И пример Максима Коробова отнюдь не самый показательный. Подумаешь - машину ГУВД Москвы догнал ! Вот другой депутат Антон Беляков это сила! На своем внедорожнике Ленд Rover он попер на танки и ракетные установки! А было так. Усталая бронетехника возвращалась с парада 9 мая по Минскому шоссе. И тут, вдруг, бодренький парламентарий, а по совместительству еще и председатель комитета по дрэгрейсингу Российской Автомобильной Федерации (т. ездить умеет), по встречной полосе подрезает плетущиеся танки, установки Град , ракетные комплексы Тополь и вклинивается в колонну. ВАИшники (военная автомобильная инспекция) о , оторопели, короче. Целый подполковник все пытался втолковать Белякову про какие-то правила, но тот быстренько его умыл своим неприкосновенным удостоверением. А потом, в лучших традициях отечественного парламентаризма, Беляков все свалил на военных: дескать, они его избили, а подполковник вообще был пьяный. К сожалению, медицинская экспертиза не подтвердила слов депутата, что убедительно свидетельствует о страшном заговоре врачей, военных и полицейских (история с Максимом Коробовым) против наших народных слуг. Ведь, повторюсь, они же никогда не врут, правда?Источник news.

From before you were born there was an angel assigned to guard you and protect you. A thousand times he has been there working silently and unseen to defend you. 
Do you understand that I actually hand crafted and created this supernatural being with just you in mind? In My earth walk when I went to the cross I chose not to call upon angelic protection. I could have been delivered from the tree had I only summoned the angel warriors. I chose not to. I refused to call upon them so I could make provision for them to come to your aid. 
Know this that the angels are working in your behalf today. The threats and pressures of the enemy are being thwarted. The strategies of hell that seem so effective at times are being dealt with by angelic warriors in your behalf. Expect a reversal and a return of My blessing in your life in a great way.

It\'s a sheer blessing! So is it wrong to date?! The gazillion dollar question. I usually answer this question this way, and just for the record, if you cannot answer this question or at least give a biblical account on it, you\'re not yet relevant to the youth! So many young people may feel that way... But my perspective is this, I say to them, \"dating is wrong, because of the premature and unnecessary responsibilities it comes with; at least as far as marriage is concerned, and you\'re not married in this instance right.\" However, dating is not wrong, say if maybe it\'s in terms of long-term commitments and has a futurist approach in the dealing and handling of it; then it becomes sort of \"justified\" that you\'re doing a wise thing and you\'re not playing nor wasting time (and resources) at the same time right. In this way, we would then call it I believe \'courtship\'; an arrangement between a couple to commit to an engagement in marriage, in the future -- which they have to find purpose from God about that. But, again, going back to scripture, we can never over-emphasise the necessity the child of God must see in living an upright life with God and you can name it: staying pure (or abstaining), laying off the sins of fornication and other pre-marital sins. Young people must also understand it is \"unlawful\" to solicit or have a girl (or lady) or guy (or gentleman) as though they are theirs, before getting married; because they\'ll actually be STEALING another man\'s property - the father\'s property. Because the lady is not yet married to the gentleman, for instance. And another thing is that they should actually share their vision, if they are in a relationship already, which is not so easy and not a child\'s play... they will progress that way! They must very clear and express onset that they have intentions of getting married, and if not, drop it like it\'s hot, until the phase of marriage, if they so wish to marry, because besides, THERE\'S NO \'COHABITATION\'!","userid": 157,"url": "blank.png"}, {"id": 415,"devotionid": 232,"full_name": "Charmaine Peterson","ts": "2012-08-03 07:42:25","comment_text": "That is true friends, prayer can change any situation.

This was the reason why the disciples became so powerful after Jesus ascended. It was because they were taught; they were full of teachings. Again, there were times when Jesus would train His disciples by sending them to go and heal the sick and to cast out demons. This is the kind of training we need as Christians.

I still remember Nelson we once had such a conversation in one of your devotions (I can\'t remember which devotion), but the conversation had to do with such an idea of coming up with Kingdom strategies for impacting lives. I love your passion man. I love your vision and I can easily tell that it\'s a God givenn vision. Nelson, I think we should have teams of Christians who go around visiting different schools in their communities and preaching the Gospel in those schools. These teams must preach the Gospel through drama, dance, singing, performances, etc. I believe that when it comes to soul winning we don\'t have to be stereotyped, whatever method we have for spreading the gospel should be applied. Business: We should have Business Seminars in different churches in our communities. In these Seminars, we should invite all people (saved or not) to come and get more teachings and advices related to the business world. Even if we don\'t invite expensive speakers, we just arrange a few powerful business speakers we know, some maybe from the very same churches. Once we can get people to attend these Business Seminars, at the end of the session we then make an alter call for those who want to accept Christ in their lives. Who should also have teams visiting jails, prisons, hospitals, etc. I believe if the government can be aware of the impact the Bodey of Christ has, they can then give the Church a more favourable consideration. As the Body of Christ, we don\'t need the government, but the government needs us.

Like anything else worth having, “We have to want it to have it, and we have to work for it to get it.” By “work” I mean, we have to meet the requirements. A person with integrity will stand up to the test any test and will come through as strong or stronger.
According to the Bible, Integrity is of the heart. See Gen. 20:5-6; First Kings 9:4; Psalm 78:72. The mind us upright, steadfast, wholesome.

And after the flood, God liberated creation and the earth from the curse (Genesis 8:20 - 9:3). God made an everlasting covenant with Noah (the generation of the second Adam, Abel, Seth, Enoch, second nature of man, Jesus), afterwards the earth gradually became suppressed again but you find that it is ALREADY liberated when you are in the second Adam (the second dimension, second nature, born-again, new creature, zoe life, Jesus Christ).
