For God loves (He takes pleasure in, prizes above other things, and is unwilling to abandon or to do without) a cheerful (joyous, \"prompt to do it\") giver [whose heart is in his giving]","bible": "Amplified","devotion": "A giver is not someone who gave, but one who has made giving his lifestyle; someone who gives liberally, regardless of what he has. A giver never has to be convinced to give because it\'s his nature to do so. Ecclesiates 11:6 \"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good\". This scripture is a revelation by which a giver lives. He never appears in God\'s house empty-handed; he is prompt to give and always seeks to out-give his past.","prayer": "Blessed Father, thank you for blessing me with all material wealth, such that I\'m self-sufficient, possessing enough to help and support others, and most of all, furnished in abundance for the furtherance of the Gospel. I refuse to let opportunities to give pass me by, in Jesus\' Name.

Glorify Him from the depths of your heart and His power will be activated in your behalf. You might have been praying about a specific condition, it\'s now time for you to Praise Him. Do it lavishly, for He deserves it, and as you do, you\'ll see His power move on you like never before.","prayer": "I will praise you O Lord, my wonderful Saviour; with my whole heart will I show forth your marvellous works and declare your greatness. I rejoice in you O Lord most high, for you\'re the only true and wise God! Thank you for making my life beautiful, and for crowning me with victory and success, all the days of my life.

Now faith means you see the end result of an issue from where you are, and then you speak it into existence. In other words, you picture the future according to the Word of God, and proclaim it into being through your spirit. Refuse to acknowledge the negative picture the devil may present to you; focus on what God says about you in His Word and picture yourself that way.","prayer": "I am all that God says I am; I have the life of God in me. The life of God is working in my family, in my businesses and in all that concerns me. I am blessed in all areas of my life. Success is mine, Victory is mine, Prosperity belongs to me.

For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.","bible": "King James Version (DCC)","devotion": "Meditating on God\'s Word is what transforms your life; it changes you. That\'s because the Word has a ministry in your life. Your promotion, success, success, health, increase and greatness are all in the Word. That\'s why Paul, writing to Timothy in 1Timothy 4:15 admonished him to give himself wholly-completely-to the ministry of the Word: \"Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all\". You ought to do the same. Yield yourself to the Word. Let the Word have power in your life.","prayer": "Dear Father, your Word is a lamp unto my path, to guide me in the way that I should go.

He is therefore our rest; and having been born again, you\'re now in Him and have therefore entered His rest. \"Rest\" here isn\'t referring to mere relaxation or taking time off work. It refers to your rest in God; it\'s our place in God, where you no longer toil, struggle and sweat for anything in life; you cease from all struggles. This is the life of rest Jesus has brought you into. Remember, He came and paid the price for your sins. He died, was buried and then raised back to life for your justification. Everything about your salvation was consummated in Him, who is today seated at the right hand of the Majesty on high. But thanks be unto God, you\'re seated together with Him in that place of power, authority and rest: \"And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus\" (Ephesians 2:6).","prayer": "Heavenly Father, I thank you for the blessing of your Word and the enlightenment it has given me today. Thank you for bringing me into a place of glorious rest in Christ Jesus, where I don\'t struggle but enjoy a blissful life of success and victory, in Jesus\' Name.

All the forces of heaven and power of divinity are working on your behalf; therefore refuse to buckle or give in to any adversity, for you\'re a victor in Christ Jesus.","prayer": "Dear Father, I see all trials and challenges that come my way as bread. No force has the ability to defeat me or throw me off balance because greater is He that lives in me than He that\'s in the world. I\'m more than a conqueror, and I live with confidence, knowing that all of heaven and power of divinity are working for me, for my good, in Jesus\' Name.

Never allow the devil to cheat you out of your inheritance through his railing accusations. If you do something wrong, acknowledge it and then accept the Lord\'s forgiveness. As you accept His forgiveness, have it in your heart that you\'ve been cleansed from all unrighteousness, and also remember your oneness with Him.","prayer": "Righteous Father, I\'m so thankful for your love and tender mercies towards me! I thank you for making me a new creation, thus qualifying me to be a partaker of your glorious inheritance! I\'m forever grateful for the blood of Jesus that was shed to purge me of all unrighteousness, and His body that was broken for me to have life, joy and peace.

They didn\'t create words; they spoke as the Holy Ghost gave them utterance. All they needed to do was to open their mouths and speak. So you can speak in tongues anytime; even now! You don\'t have to try to force the utterance. The Holy Spirit in you inspires those heavenly words in your spirit, which you\'re to speak forth in other tongues. So it\'s up to you to open your mouth in faith and speak in tongues whenever you choose!","prayer": "Dear Father, thank you for the indwelling presence of your Spirit in my life. He\'s the one who gives me the ability to speak in tongues: that heavenly language given to us to communicate directly to you. I take advantage of this unique ability today and always, in Jesus\' Name.

The Gospel of the Kingdom therefore is the announcement that it\'s now possible for all men to have God\'s Kingdom set up in their hearts. This wasn\'t possible in the days of Abraham, Moses, Elijah, and David. But now, in Christ Jesus, it\'s possible for anyone who believes on His Name to receive the life, presence, beauty and glory of God in his heart. It\'s now possible for God to be at home in your heart and set up His headquarters in you! What a great blessing this is! God wants the whole world to know they can have the Kingdom of God set up in their hearts. No wonder He says in Ecclesiastes 3:11 that He has set eternity in the hearts of men. The Kingdom is in your heart, and you operate in it by functioning according to God\'s Word.","prayer": "Dear Father, thank you for entrusting me with the Gospel of the Kingdom, and for settling up eternity in my heart! I take this same message to everyone in my world today, and as I do, their eyes are open to see the realities of the Kingdom, and the great life you\'ve ordained for them, in Jesus\' Name.

But what does it mean? It\'s such a vague generality that most people don\'t have the slightest idea what it means to be blessed by God. 

A blessing is a sovereign act of God, where he takes someone or something that is normal -- and then he supernaturally produces that which is naturally impossible in order to meet your needs. 

That\'s what you pray when you ask God to bless your family. You\'re saying, \"God, I want you to bless every area of my family and meet the needs of each of my family members.\" I want you to be blessed by God this year and this decade.

In fact, I want you to begin to look at this decade as your Decade of Destiny. If you are going to experience the blessings that God has stored up for you, you need to do two things: you have to ask for them and you have to keep God\'s rules.","prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, may I never again in my life deduce your power to work the supernatural and the power of your blessing or the knowledge of being blessed by you. I acknowledge and honor \"The Blessing of the Lord\" in my life and of others, even when I bless others with my words. May I experience your blessing (going in and out) in this decade of destiny in Jesus\' Name.

Practice writing at every opportunity and improve your vocabulary. Before long, you\'ll be the best writer around. This applies to any field of endeavour; once you\'ve made a decision to be the best, train yourself; put your abilities before you and say \"Now, I will manage them till I become the best\". Also, avoid distractions. You can\'t spend several hours of your day watching movies for example and expect to be the best in anything serious. Instead of watching the news from sun up to sun down, make up your mind to make the news. Train yourself; start reading the right materials and invest in your mind. Be a student, a banker or a lawyer with a difference. Drive your mind to improve your abilities; \"wake up and run!\"","prayer": "Dear Father, thank you for giving me the ability to be the best in everything I do. thank you for helping me gain the mastery in my field; I function today at a high level of excellence, in Jesus\' Name.

It\'s important that you look beyond the deeds of the unsaved around you and consider what they could become through the power of the Gospel. See the beauty in them and their potential greatness, for the Word of God has the ability to transform any life. This kind of thinking would motivate you to preach the Gospel to every sinner. Remember, you\'re the custodian of eternal verities. God has invested so much in you and has made you His partner in reaching others. You\'re his steward of the Gospel message; and that\'s the only message that can bring salvation to the sinner. So reach out today and bless your world with the message of Christ\'s salvation.","prayer": "Dear Father, thank you for making me a custodian of the Gospel message, the only message that can save the sinner, and bring them into eternal life.

Your unique gift is in your ability to render help to others and help them make their dreams come true, in spite of themselves. The Bible says: \"If you have the gift of helping others, do it with the strength that God supplies...\" (1 Peter 4:11 CEV). Keep helping others, whether or not they remember you or reciprocate your kindness. As you do, God will keep increasing you and multiplying your ability to be a blessing. Don\'t let fear, doubt, unbelief, resentment, and bitterness hinder you from your ministry as a blesser, a giver and lifter of others. Always be excited and exuberant with faith, knowing that God is the one who rewards you for your kindness and labour of love towards others.","prayer": "Dear Father, thank you for the opportunity I have to help others and make their dreams come true.

So, we can commonly agree that we reach a certain level in our faith where God is the Father and Creator of all things, and not God anymore, or, at least, not just God! Now, the Bible says, \"All of creation awaits eagerly for the manifestation of the Sons of God. And not only they, but ourselves too; we are groaning for the revelation of our true selves in God.\" Romans 8:19-20 The Bible is clear, and not mistaken, when it says \'sons\' -- not daughters. Because it is sons by inheritance in the spirit and not by gender, as the world has perpetually made this fault and sown divisions amongst the two genders. Just understand that we were created in unison; that\'s all. Being Sons of God is what Jesus has accomplished though His work, and we received it by grace through faith. May we walk in the light of this revelation and operate here on earth as \'Sons of God\'. Merry Christmas; Pray against paganism on that day, that is my  request!","prayer": "CONFESSION: We have been purchased by the most expensive price, which is the blood of the lamb of God, that we may come back to God and live in union with Christ. Through the work of Jesus Christ, in union with Him, it is no longer I who\'s living but Christ in me. It is through the work of the Father and the Son of God, Jesus Christ, that I am made to become a Son of God (and as a Son of God) through the Spirit of God - Holy Spirit.

Such was the case for the apostle Paul when he went to the city of Ephesus.  There was a territorial principality that was worshipped by the people of Ephesus named Diana of the Ephesians (also known by her Greek name, Artemis). The people gave money to this false god and it strongly influenced the economy because of this. The city was also the center for magic and the occult.

Her temple in Ephesus was listed as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World – the most outstanding and opulent example of architecture in the whole city. Her followers called her “magnificent,” “great goddess,” “savior,” and “Queen of Heaven.”

Paul preached in Asia for two years and had great success confronting this territorial principality. Paul began to neutralize the Queen of Heaven’s power so much by the gospel that the common people began to notice. They not only stopped worshipping and sacrificing to her, the silversmith’s who were manufacturing idols were going out of business, so they staged a public riot. They filled the huge amphitheater and shouted for two hours, “Great is Diana of the Ephesians” (Acts 19:34).

Many who were converted burned all of the idols and magic books. “When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power” (Acts 19:20). Based on the U.S. economy today, the pile of magic paraphernalia that was burned would have been worth four million dollars!*

In order for you to impact your city you must identify and break down the ruling principalities that may be hindering the gospel there. The more common principalities in the western world would include the religious spirit, the spirit of mammon, pride, and freemasonry to name a few.

Ask God for wisdom and discernment as you prepare to deal with your local and regional principalities.

I know this question may sound strange to many and funny to some and annoying to others. No one believes they can live in a graveyard while they are in their right mind. Many intelligent clever folks might think it’s crazy to ask such a question. My bishop Rev. Dr. Darlingston G. Johnson defined graveyard as a “MONUMENT of the past.” Let’s take for instance a statue. A statue is a monument of the past. Whenever you see a statue, it does not tell you anything in the present, it tells you about the past.
With that definition from my bishop in mind, the question above no doubt is a relevant one. It certainly show in clear ways that people are living in graveyards and yet don’t know. What you see in the graveyard is nothing but the past. If you want to remember someone who 40 or more years ago, the graveyard will be the ideal place to remember that person.
In Isaiah 43:18 it says “Remember not the former things; neither consider the things of old.” This text also supports the fact that there are people who are living in graveyards. Again remember the definition from my bishop; it’s a monument of the past.
Do you know a man or a woman can be driving a nice car; wear nice clothes, and yet be living in a graveyard? I guess someone may now be asking how that is possible. Please keep in mind our definition from my bishop.
In Mark 5:1-20 there is man called Legion. He lived in the graveyard physically, that was his residential address. Today like legion many are living in the graveyard but in a different way. For Legion he lived there physically, but for many today they are living there mentally and spiritually.
Few ways that shows a person lives in the graveyard:
If you are still holding something against someone who hurt you in the past, you are living in the graveyard
If you are still upset with folks who didn’t support you yesterday, you are living in the graveyard
If you are still angry with your parents because they were not there for you when you were growing up, you are living in the graveyard
If you are still frustrated and angry over a deal that did not work in the past, you are living in the graveyard
Remember: the graveyard is a MONUMENT of the past.
But Jesus comes that you will have a changed address. He comes to set you free from the past. He comes to change your story. He comes to give you a future and a hope. It does not matter what you may have gone through or are going through now, Jesus can change any story and give hope.
In Isaiah 43: 18-19 tells us that there is no need to live in the graveyard. You ask why? God say he is doing something new that do not have any resemblance of the past. He’s doing something NEW with no graveyard address or connection.

Topic: Change your thinking
In the book of Romans chapter 12:2, Paul writes “ And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.”
Everything that we go through in life has so much to do with the mind. Paul made it clear here that all we need in life is true and genuine transformation.  It remains to be also true that real transformation comes with a renewed mind.
In the book of Proverb 23:7, it says that as a man thinketh so is he. The mind plays a very important role as to who we become or what we become etc. whether you are a success or a failure starts from the mind. Transformation is different from Reformation. The first is an internal change and the second is an external change. In other words Transformation deals with the inside where as Reformation deals with the outside. Real change starts from inside out.
Many people are held captive by their thoughts. God did not create you to be poor, but your mind tells you because your parents were poor so you too will remain and die poor. The mind is the battlefield of our spiritual warfare. As you long as you can conquer it in the mind you can conquer it everywhere.
So when Paul says be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, he was simply saying change your thinking. Changing your thinking is so vital to becoming what God created you to be. This is what will happen when you change your thinking:
When you change your thinking, your belief will change;
When your beliefs change, your expectations will change;
When your expectations change, your attitude will change;
When your attitudes change, your behavior will change; 
When you behavior change, your results will change
When your results change, your life eventually will change.
So it is an issue of the mind. Change the way you see yourself. Change the way you talk. Change the way respond to situations. A transformed life starts with a change of mind.","prayer": "LORD HELP US TO CHANGE OUR THOUGH PATTERN WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY CHANGE EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT AND AROUND US.","ts": 2012-03-31 23:23:32}, {"id": 32,"dt": "","pastor": 16,"theme": "Only a Donkey","scripture": "John 12:12","reading": "12 On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 13 Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed [is] the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. 14 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, 15 Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass\'s colt. 16  These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and [that] they had done these things unto him. 17 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. 18 For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. 19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.","bible": "KING JAMES","devotion": "Text: John 12:12-19
Topic: Only a Donkey
In our text above, Jesus Christ was on his way to Jerusalem, knowing full well that his time was near for his sacrificial death for the sins of mankind. About a mile away from the city at the foot of the Mount of Olives, He sent two disciples ahead to the village of Bethphage with specific instructions to look for a donkey tied by a house, with its unbroken colt next to it. Jesus told the disciples to tell the owners of the animal that \"The Lord has need of it.\" 
The men found the donkey just as Jesus said and brought it and its colt to him. Jesus sat on the young donkey and slowly, humbly, made his triumphal entry into Jerusalem.  People threw their cloaks on the ground and put palm branches on the road before him, while others waved palm branches in the air.
The donkey has been tied there I believed for a good period of time. No one took notice of the donkey for it had been tied. The fact that donkey was tied meant that it was limited in terms of movement. Like the donkey there are many who are tied down by circumstances in life and no one seems to notice them, limited by these circumstances that have tied them. And Jesus sends his disciples to lose this donkey and bring it to him.
The people put cloaks and palm branches in the path. Notice it was not Jesus walking on the palm branches, but rather the donkey. What if the donkey would have thought that the people were shouting for it? No the shouting was not for the donkey. Isn’t it funny how when things start happening for some people and jubilation and shouts arises they begin to think it’s about them? The shout certainly was not for the donkey but Jesus. When God begin to done great things in our lives and jubilation and shouting arises, let us remember it not about us, it’s about God.
The donkey understood that it was only a donkey doing what it was loosen to do, take the master into Jerusalem. The donkey that had been tied for so long, that no one took notice of suddenly gains the notice of many. When we do what we have been lose to do and called to do though we might not have been notice, suddenly many will begin to notice us. Naturally no one would have put cloaks and palm branches in the path of a donkey, but because the donkey was with Jesus and doing what it was lose to do.
The donkey understood its mission and wanted to be nothing else but a conveyer, a medium of transport to take the master into the final end of his sacrificial journey. Like the donkey, I don’t want to be anything else but a donkey that the master will use for his glory and honor. Like the donkey don’t  lose your identity, be what you are and do what you’ve lose to do.

Here are some important points that we need to know from this Palm Sunday Story:
• When Jesus told the disciples to get the donkey, He referred to himself as \'The Lord,\' a definite proclamation of his divinity.
• By riding into Jerusalem on the colt of a donkey, Jesus fulfilled an ancient prophecy in Zechariah 9:9: \"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; righteous and having salvation is he, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.\" This was the only instance in the Gospels in which Jesus rode an animal.
• Throwing cloaks in the path of someone was an act of homage and submission. The people were recognizing Jesus as the promised Messiah.
• The people\'s cries of \'Hosanna\' came from Psalm 118:25-26. Hosanna means \"save now.\" Despite what Jesus had foretold about his mission, the people were looking for a military Messiah who would overthrow the Romans and restore Israel\'s independence.
The crowds refused to see Jesus as he truly was; rather they were placing their personal desires on him instead. 
My question to you this Palm Sunday is: Who is Jesus to you? Is he someone whom you want to satisfy your selfish wants and goals, or is he Lord and Master who gave up his life to save you from your sins?","prayer": "Lord help us to realized our purpose in life and know that it\'s all about you","ts": 2012-04-01 16:51:20}, {"id": 33,"dt": "","pastor": 3,"theme": "The hardness of heart","scripture": "Mark 6:45","reading": "Immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He sent the multitude away. 46 And when He had sent them away, He departed to the mountain to pray. 47 Now when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea; and He was alone on the land. 48 Then He saw them straining at rowing, for the wind was against them.

Bear in mind, whatever you consider, your heart becomes sensitive to, and whatever you don\'t consider, your heart becomes hardened to. The disciples, after seeing Jesus multiply food, they could not stop the storm when they were in the boat, because they did not meditate upon past miracles which they had seen Jesus do.

fighting God too. Reject that invitation to the

Faith requires you to see in the spirit and not in the flesh, Faith requires you to believe against terrible situations you might be seeing in the flesh, Faith requires you to see things exactly the way God sees them. Basically, Faith is the nature of God, we serve a Faith God, that is why it is impossible to please Him without Faith because He is a Faith God. Child of God, don\'t let your life be controlled by your 5 senses, above all things, you must always believe in God\'s Word, In this way you will please God because you will be living a Faith Filled Life.","prayer": "I do not walk by sight, I walk by Faith. Above all things I believe in God\'s Word. I refuse to believe what I see in the flesh, I refuse to live according to my 5 senses, I REFUSE. I choose to live by Faith all the days of my life. I will do everything by Faith.

As I continued in studying God\'s Word and also meditating on His Word, I received this revelation that I am a spirit and that God is also Spirit. It\'s simple, the only person who can lead soldiers is a person who is in that same field, the only person who can lead doctors can only be a person who is in that field of medicine; We cannot expect a doctor to lead soldiers, and we also cannot expect a soldier to lead doctors. Anyone can only lead people who are within his/her parameters. In the same way, God can only led those who are in the Spirit, that is why He even calls them His Sons. The bible says in the same book of Romans 1:1, \"there is now no condemnation to those who are in Christ, WHO DO NOT WALK ACCORDING TO THE FLESH, BUT ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT. You see, a person who is in the flesh or lives according to the flesh, is outside the borders of God, that person cannot walk in the ways of God, that person cannot please God, because he is not within God\'s Kingdom.

And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, who touched me?  And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.

Life has a way of taking you from high to low, happy to sad, strong to weak and from have to have not.
Our text above speaks of a woman, with no name only described as “a certain woman.” This woman was experiencing the sting of life in her own life, to an extent I am sure she had never imagined.
She is infected with an issue of blood for twelve (12) years. This means for over eleven years, she had to deal with this painful, shameful and disgraceful situation.
By this time all her friends and perhaps some family members left her. For more than eleven years she sought for solution to her situation but to no avail. The bible says she visited all the doctors in town, yet without any positive result.
The fact that she could visit all the doctors in town suggests that she was well to do financially. One thing that we need to know is that life can hand you stuff that money, fame, prestige or connections cannot solve.
The bible tells us that one day, perhaps while she was in her hiding place she heard some by-passers who came from one Jesus’ regular miracle meetings talking about what he Jesus had done and the great miracles that took place that day.
What great news for this victim of life’s circumstances. The bible did not say she had seen Jesus before, it says she heard about him. She developed a “historical faith.” Permit me to expose four major points gathered from this story about this un-named woman.
1.    The first point gathered here is that this was a woman of Endurance. When life hands you stuff you got no control over no matter how humanly you try, all you need to do is endure. Endurance puts you in the position of expectation. When you endure, you expect your situation to change even though you might not know when or how, but you are sure it will.
2.    The second point is that this was a woman of patience. In the face of all the scorn a laughter she was faced with, she knew there was solution somewhere, and was prepared to wait, to be patient until it show up. She stepped into Job shoes when Job said “I will wait until my change comes.”
3.    The third point is that she was a woman of Faith. Her endurance kept her in expectation, her patience kept her focus on the expected change, but her faith put everything into motion. She said to herself if but I can touch the helm of his garment. She braved all the odds and move forward. Faith will cause you to ignore all impossibilities and energize you to step over walls to receive what God has for you.
I guess her neighbors were surprise to see her leaving her hiding place and they might have probably been wondering where she going. Some maybe thought she was moving out of the community. Notice when she was healed, Jesus told her exactly what made her healed. He said your FAITH has healed thee.
4.    Finally she was a woman of persistency. You might think that she was going to find Jesus free and touch him without difficulty no it was not the case.
And if a woman has an issue, [and] her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the evening. (Lev. 15: 19)
As stated in the text above she had some odds against. First she was unclean to be in the midst and secondly she was a woman coming to where there were predominantly men.
Her persistency to take hold of the helm of his garment, kept her resisting any attempt to stop her from doing so. It was her persistency that brought her desire change and healing. She  knew for sure that “IT WAS TIME” for her to be set free and was prepared to persist and resist until she got what she has long waited for the past eleven and a half years.
If you will overcome the obstacles that life throws your way, you must be a man or woman of Endurance, Patience, Faith and Persistency. Know it\'s your time.","prayer": "Lord teach us to be people of endurance, patience, faith and persistency.","ts": 2012-04-13 07:47:02}, {"id": 45,"dt": "","pastor": 6,"theme": "Find Your Joy In God","scripture": "Psalms 1:1","reading": "Blessed is the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the sits of the scornful; Verse 2: But his delight is in the law of the Lord, And in His law he meditates day and night.

Note this: everything you need in your life, is wrapped up in God\'s Word.

The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn","bible": "KING JAMES","devotion": "The Kingdom of God is like a garden. It operates by seed, which is the Kingdom principle.

The text is about a man who sowed seed, yes he did but then something happened.

The Bible says while men slept, the enemy came and planted tares among his wheat. Notice it did not happen while they were awake. It says while they slept. The enemy will never do a thing to the child of God who is awake and alert.


The enemy always has plans for the child of God, evil plans that is. See it says here but when the blade was sprung up, and it brought forth fruit; something happened- then appear the tares also (vs.26). The plan of the enemy was for the tare to also appear with the wheat. They expected fruit and they got it. What they did not expect was the tare.

When things are turning the way you expected, then the unexpected comes. When the best moments of your life come out, there is a tendency for the unexpected to come out. The enemy planted the tares among the wheat so that they could come up together

There are things you can cause in your life by what you sow but there also things that the enemy can cause in your life. In this case they got what they sowed. Whatever you put in the ground is what you will take out. Remember you will reap what you sowed. If you want love sow love

Whatever you sow is what you reap. Put time into your business, family etc, you will reap what you put in.

When you pray you ask God for a harvest, but He will give you a seed because the Kingdom operates by seed. The Bible says as long as the earth remains there will seed time and harvest time, sowing time and reaping time.

I believe the reason many Christians are not getting harvest is because they do not understand the difference between the seed and the harvest. They use their seed as harvest. It is not the harvest that produces the seed, rather it is the see that produce the harvest. No seed, no harvest.

Notice it say in (verse 26), but when the blade sprung up (which means they planted their seed), and it brought forth fruit, and then appear the tares also. The tares appear when the blade sprung up. When the unexpected show up in your harvest, know it is your reason. The tares did not show up until the blade did. The blade brings the fruit which means it is your season to harvest. Whenever the unexpected shows up in your life, you need to remind yourself, it is my season. You started a business and thought that all will be fine then something happened. You got married and thought that it all would be great and fine and then something happened. The unexpected will always come.

WHY will the enemy plant tares among your wheat?
The enemy will plant tares among your wheat or the enemy will plant things in your life to abort the purpose of God for your life.

Just when you are about to experience what God has in store for you then the tares show up. The best time and the worst of time all springs up together.

Didn’t we sow good seed in the field? They tried to make sense out of the situation. They knew they sow good seed, so any thing other then the good seed was not their doing. They were certain that they sow good seeds.

There are some things that happen in your life that does not make sense, but God want to use it for His glory

The man born blind- the disciples tried to make sense of it by asking whose sin was he born blind, and Jesus replied… so that glory of God would be reveal.

You will never know the integrity of what God has place inside you until there are opposition

They wanted to undo what they did not do. Will thou then that we go and gather them up? Notice they wanted to pluck up the tares immediately. Immediately!!!!!!

Watch out for quick fixes on the unexpected. Quick fixes can increase damage. Like they say in Liberia, quick, quick burst trousers. Stand still and compose yourself


Notice the master’s reply to the request to go and pull the tares up. He said to them “leave it alone.”  They wanted to do a quick fixing but the master said no, leave it alone. There is a time for everything under the sun (Eccl. 3:1).  The master said when the time is right I will cut it off.

You need to understand that the fight is God’s fight. Hold you peace and let the Lord fight your battle. Time is very important in the kingdom of God. Watch out for doing the right thing at the wrong time.

Moses was a deliverer but had wrong timing when he starting fighting and killing. God had to send him to the back side of the desert to learn real leadership. If he could deal with real sheep, as stubborn as they are, surely he could lead the sheep of God.
  
Many times when people are in a situation they pray that God deliver them from it, but the truth is that God want to deliver them through it.

When you come into your season, you come into it with the problem but your season isn’t over yet. It was their time to harvest but they came into their season with a problem.

If you will deal with the unexpected you must compose yourself, so that you can make one radical decision that is not control by your emotion. A godly decision not control by your emotion.

Theme: Keep your lamp full
Your daily goal as God\'s child is to simply stay in union with the risen Savior. Staying in union with the risen Savior gives you the courage and strength need to live for him. When you stay in union with the risen Savior, you find meaning for living. Many are struggling to the Christian life all because they are doing it apart from him-the risen Savior.
Our text is about ten virgins. Interestingly five were wise and five foolish. Being wise is remembered to do what is important or what you ought to do and doing it. Five were wise and remembered what to do, the other five were foolish for they could not remember what to do, and they had no vision so to speak. They did not foresee the future. When you stay in union with the risen Savior you are assured of the future. 
How can you keep your lamp full? You can keep your lamp full   by remembering:
1. Life in Jesus is hard when you load your heart and mind with burdens you were not meant to carry. When you let yourself carry unassigned burdens, His will is misunderstood. You begin to think He is not fair or that you have to measure up to the task. Soon you begin to think the task is too hard to do. Some blame it on a non-existent demon, wondering why he doesn\'t obey the name of Jesus. Carrying a burden you were never meant to carry can turn into bondage (Galatians 5:1). The devil wants you to think serving Jesus is impossible. Serving Jesus is meant to be a joy. Yes, there are demons, but they are not meant to run your life, Jesus is. Take the authority Jesus has given you and walk in freedom (Luke 10:19)!
2. Life in Jesus is hard when you carry any burden except the one He has for you. Here are three types of burdens: 
a) Yours (Galatians 6:5); 
b) Others that are assigned to you – help each other when it is in your power to do so (Galatians 6:2);
 c) And Christ\'s (Matthew 11:28-30). We must stay in union with Him and \"learn of Him.\" Many saints started out serving Him with great energy and sincere commitment, but having familiarity rather than intimacy with Jesus, they wound up frustrated, discouraged and confused. God\'s rest eludes them.
3. Life in Jesus is easy when you know you have but one responsibility: Staying in union with Him, abiding in Him (John 15:4). Unless we are in union with Him, we cannot keep the commandments. We will not have the strength. Besides, everything we do outside of Him will produce things that add up to nothing. Nothing means zero, blank, you lose, unproductive, no lasting fruit.
4. Life in Jesus is easy when you realize His commandments are not grievous (I John 5:3). Jesus will never give you more than you can bear, temptation-wise (I Corinthians 10:13) and burden-wise (Numbers 11:11-17). Life is easy when you realize His grace is always sufficient (2 Corinthians 12:9) for each day.
5. Life in Jesus is easy when we recognize that He can appear in a vast array of disguises, ready to become visible in any circumstance or through any vessel. Jesus can be mistaken for a gardener (John 20:15) or a stranger (Luke 24:16). When we are in union with the Master, we will be amazed at how He will suddenly manifest Himself to us. The Lord will sometimes speak through the most unlikely vessels, like you and me.
When Jesus died on that Cross, He made something available to you and me...the ability to rest in the midst of chaos.
Many years ago, a little boy was given a priceless possession: his deceased grandfather\'s gold pocket watch. How he treasured it! But one day, while playing at his father\'s ice plant, he lost the watch amid all the ice and sawdust. He searched, becoming frantic, but no watch. Then he suddenly realized what to do. He stopped scurrying around and became very still. In the silence, he heard the watch ticking.
God has given each of us the priceless gift of resting in Him. How easy it is to lose His rest in the business of our life. Yet, it is always there to find, if we will but pause and listen to the presence of Jesus in our hearts.
Today rest in Him. Lay that burden down at His feet. He is waiting to lift it off of you. The spirit of heaviness is about to be lifted off of many (Isaiah 61:3). Go to Him today and:

In all of his harassment,temptations and attacks, the Devils\' forces seek to establish long term strongholds in which they may hold captive and dominate individuals.  Those Devils forces seek entry to individuals, places, nations in which they can dwell where they are not restricted, they are allowed to dwell and blossom.

The devils strategy is to make his activities seem like someone else is to blame. He wants us to loose focus on the \"real source\" of our problems, so we keep battling our \"symptoms\". 
We can fight with the Devils\' symptoms but our problems will still be there until we bind the \"strong man\" himself.
Jesus Himself explained that in order for us to overturn the works and activities of the devil we must bind him first,cause you can get to the root if you don\'t get rid of the head. then we can take back all he has taken from us and bring a stop to his actions.

We all as children of God must be aware of our weapons of warfare, in other words we are equipped with the power to overcome satan, the apostle Paul said it in Corinthians 2:10:4.

Bear in mind, the Word says \"there is no condemnation to those in Christ, who do not walk according to the FLESH but according to the SPIRIT!\" This means that it is possible to be in Christ and still walk in the flesh; But the part for no condemnation applies only for those who are in Christ and also walk according to the SPIRIT. What does it mean when a person is in Christ and walks according to the flesh? It means this person is now born-again, this person is a new creation, this person has accepted Christ in his/her heart, BUT this person still desires the things of the world, this person still speaks and behaves like the world, this person is still subject to his/her fleshly desires, this person still loves the things of the world; A person like this is a person who is in Christ, but walks according to the flesh! The bible teaches us that God is Spirit, and now that we are in Him, we should walk in the Spirit and according to the Spirit. Now that we are in Christ, we should desire the things of the Spirit, because the flesh does not please God, In-fact you cannot please God in the flesh. So, if you\'re born-again and still walk according to the flesh, then you are heading towards condemnation; But when you are born-again and walk according to the Spirit, then there is NO condemnation for you. The bible says in the same book of Romans 8:6, \"To be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.\" You See Now!

You posses God\'s life in you; This means that you should always go beyond the borders which would limit an unbeliever, because you serve a God who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you ask or think, according to the power that works in you! You see! The power which God uses to do mighty things in our lives, is the power which is already at work in us. So, don\'t limit God, because in you there is power which God can use to do great and mighty things; So when you limit Him, you are actually preventing Him from accessing that power which is already in you. One of the things which the devil can use in order to cause you to limit God is \'fear\'. The bible says in 2 Timothy 1:7, \"For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind\". Fear can cause you to limit God; It can cause you to draw back from doing the great things which God has anointed you to do. Don\'t allow fear to take hold of you, God has not given you the spirit of fear; fear does not come from God, don\'t allow the devil to pull you down using fear; Whenever you feel the challenge of fear, Speak out and say: GOD HAS NOT GIVEN ME THE SPIRIT OF FEAR, HE HAS GIVEN ME THE SPIRIT OF POWER! According to God\'s Word, God does not want us to live ordinary lives; We should never limit Him, because He has invested so much power in us. Therefore, we ought to live extra ordinary lives, we ought to do great and mighty things, we ought to function in great power; What is impossible to others should be possible to us because of the great power which God has already imparted into us. Where the world fails, we ought to succeed, for we are born of God.

That is so wrong guys! That is not what it means to wait on God. Bear in mind, according to God\'s Word, God is more eager to bless you that you are eager to receive. God is so much desirous to see  you enjoying the fullness of your inheritance. So, why would He cause you to wait or to stop in doing something! God will not stop you or cause you to wait when you want to do something great for Him. So what exactly does it means to wait on God? It means to \'TRUST\' in God! It means \'NOT TAKING MATTERS INTO YOUR OWN HANDS\', it does not mean \'stopping\'. Let\'s say for example there\'s a big project you want to commence and you don\'t have enough money at the starting point of the project; Then waiting on God would mean that you begin the project and then trust in God for the rest of the finances to complete the project, without being unfaithful in obtaining the finances! Waiting on God should never be an expression of laziness or the fear of beginning; Because many people are actually afraid of beginning, therefore they say they are waiting on God; Others are lazy to work, therefore they say they are waiting on God! Dear friend, waiting on God means trusting in God for everything; Waiting on the Lord means not depending on your own strategies and plans, as the bible says in Proverbs 3:5 \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding\". This is what it means to wait on God. So Kt, can I do anything at any time and trust God for it??? NO! There is something called \'the wisdom of waiting\', but that\'s a subject for another day!

What is amazing about this is that fighting (fighting with someone) is something which is totally wrong before the Lord, yet God tells us to fight the good fight of faith! Why does God refer to this fight as good? There are two reasons why God refers to this fight as \'good\'. Number 1: in this fight you are not fighting with anyone! LOL!!! Isn\'t that ironic? You are in a fight but you are not fighting against anyone. YES, it\'s true, in this fight you are not fighting anyone. Many Christians think that God says we should fight a good fight of faith against the devil. NO! We are not fighting with the devil; The devil has been totally defeated, Colossians 2:15 makes us aware that Jesus disarmed the kingdom of darkness and made a public spectacle of them, So there is no way we can still be fighting the devil because the devil has been TOTALLY defeated. Always keep it in mind that when God talks about us fighting a good fight of faith, He doesn\'t mean that we should fight with the devil, NO! The devil has been defeated, he has been disarmed, he is now left with NOTHING but a BIG mouth which is full of lies. Number 2: in this fight, the results/outcome is guaranteed from the very beginning. WOW! So the fight is predictable??? YES! You can easily tell the outcome of the fight. So, What exactly is a good fight of faith??? Fighting a good fight of faith means \'keeping what you have already received!\' It means \'protecting what already belongs to you!\' As God\'s Sons and Daughters, our battle is not to take, it is to keep! Remember, at the cross Jesus said these words \'it is finished\', and again remember the Word says we are \'joint heirs\' with Christ, meaning that whatever belongs to Christ also belong to us, and whatever has been given to Christ by the Father also was given to us! So the good fight of faith is standing in faith to keep and protect my inheritance as a Son or Daughter of God! It has got nothing to do with the devil. What I have to do is to abide in God\'s Word (John 8:31) so that I don\'t lose my identity in Christ; then be able to keep what is already mine! Child of God, stay in the Word, stay in meditation of God\'s Word, stay in prayer, stay in Love, This is what it really is to fight a good fight of faith! It is protecting/keeping/sustaining/growing/watering what is already  yours. Stay Blessed!!!","prayer": "Dear Father, thank you for making me aware that I am blessed in all areas of my life, thank you that whatever belongs to Jesus Christ also belongs to me, thank you that I am a joint heir with Jesus Christ my brother!

Speaking in tongues is something which each and every believer must do. If you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and have accepted His Lordship in your life, you must pray in tongues! Therefore, speaking in tongues is not a gift, it\'s a believer\'s portion. It is very important as a child of God to pray in tongues; What are tongues? Tongues are the mysterious language of the Spirit; This is a language of the Spirit which can only be understood by God and all those to whom the Holy Spirit interprets it. Praying in tongues is something which every born-again believer must do; Even if you don\'t understand what you are saying, you must continue in the lifestyle of praying in tongues. The bible is clear that when we pray in tongues, it is our spirits praying and our minds are unfruitful (1Cor 14:14); So you don\'t necessarily have to understand what you are saying, you just have to allow your spirit to pray in tongues, because praying in tongues is your portion as a believer of Jesus Christ! Just open up your mouth and begin to pray in the spirit, you do not need anyone to teach you how to speak in tongues; already you have the ability to speak in tongues because you believe in the Lord Jesus; So, according to God\'s Word, the qualification for speaking in tongues is only believing in the Lordship of Jesus Christ and accepting His Lordship in your life. If you have accepted Christ in your life, then you don\'t need a Pastor to come and lay hands on you before you can speak in tongues, Just open up your mouth and begin to speak in tongues by faith! Do it by faith! Remember the Word of God says that it is impossible to please God without faith (Hebrews 11:6), so open up your mouth by faith and begin to speak in tongues; You don\'t have to understand what you are saying, Just speak in tongues by faith, allow your spirit to say mysteries to God, DO IT BY FAITH!!! You may be asking yourself: What happens when I pray in tongues? This is what happens: Tongues put your in a better position for hearing God. When you live a lifestyle of praying in tongues, it becomes so EASY to hear God. God is always talking to us, but for some Christians it is so much difficult to hear Him, this is because of their spiritual positioning, So when you pray in tongues, you come to a better position of hearing God! Tongues also cause God to act on your behalf! By just praying in tongues, the life of your cousin can be saved. By just praying in tongues, your child can be prevented from being in an accident, your house can be protected from burglary, and many more things!

When God told Israel to be holy in Leviticus 11 and 19, He was instructing them to be distinct from the other nations by giving them specific regulations to govern their lives. Israel is God\'s chosen nation and God has set them apart from all other people groups. They are His special people, and consequently they were given standards that God wanted them to live by so the world would know they belonged to Him. When Peter repeats the Lord\'s words in 1 Peter 1:16, he is talking specifically to believers. As believers, we need to be \"set apart\" from the world unto the Lord. We need to be living by God\'s standards, not the world\'s. God isn\'t calling us to be perfect, but to be distinct from the world. First Peter 2:9 describes believers as \"a holy nation.\" It is a fact! We are separated from the world; we need to live out that reality in our day-to-day lives, which Peter tells us how to do in 1 Peter 1:13-16.
Finally, how can we become holy? Holiness only results from a right relationship with God by believing in Jesus Christ as Savior (accepting His gift of eternal life). If we have not placed our faith in God\'s Son alone to save us from our sins, then our pursuit of holiness is in vain. So, we must first make sure we are born-again believers (see John 3). If we truly are believers, then we recognize that our position in Christ automatically sets us apart from the world (1 Peter 2:9). After all, we have a relationship with the living God! Then we must daily live a set-apart life, not trying to \"blend in\" with the world, but instead living according to God\'s Word as we study the Bible and grow in it.","prayer": "Lord help us to live a holy life at all times,help us to engrave your word on the table of our hearts so that we do not sin against thee...Amen","ts": 2012-11-13 12:28:26}, {"id": 356,"dt": "","pastor": 95,"theme": "God\'s word is final...","scripture": "Luke 1:37","reading": "For nothing is impossible with God...","bible": "NIV","devotion": "1) Trouble doesn\'t mean that God has abandoned you. The disciples learned that Jesus may be out of sight, but He\'s never out of touch. To \'...walk by faith, not by sight\' (2 Corinthians 5:7 NKJV) means sometimes you\'ll walk in darkness without visible cues. Someone put it this way: \'When you can\'t trace His hand, you can trust His heart.\' When the disciples were being tossed like a cork on the waves, Jesus was up on a mountain praying for them! He was aware of the problem and He was working on the solution. He was their mediator and their \'need meet-er\', just as He has one hand on your need and the other on your answer. \'...He always lives to intercede for [you]\' (Hebrews 7:25 NIV). Can you imagine Jesus praying to the Father for His fear-filled disciples? And can you imagine the Father refusing to answer His prayers? Never! \'...The Spirit himself intercedes for us...\' (Romans 8:26 NIV). With both Jesus and the Holy Spirit talking to the Father on your behalf, your victory is guaranteed.

Topic: The Lord is my Shepherd
Introduction:
The 23 Psalms is one of the wrtings of David that identifies his own occupation and function as a person. David no doubt pen this Psalm knowing exactly who a shepherd is. Remember he was also a shepherd to his father Jesse’s sheep. David had a complete insight of the work and duty of a shephered.
As a shepherd himself to natural sheep he understood well what our heavenly shepherd is to us. David knew the protection, care that he was providing to his father’s sheep and he no doubt knew that the Good Shepherd of our souls was even more than what he was to his father’s sheep.
David understood that the sheep depended on him for everything and they needed not to concern themselves with anything as it relates to their daily lives, what they would eat, safety, security, etc.
David knew it was all his concern to care for the sheep. When the bear and lion showed up, it was no concern of the sheep, it was the concern of the shepherd. It was David who had to deal with the lion and the bear, for it was his duty to protect them. It is not mentioned anywhere that the sheep helped David to kill the lion and the bear. In David’s testimony to Saul, he “a lion and bear came and I slew them…” nothing is mentioned about the sheep helping.
In our text above we can clearly see that David for sure knew that God was his shepherd and as he was to his father’s sheep, more so was God the Good Shepherd to him. David knew that God was more than able to take care of everything that concerned him.
David claimed, if the Lord is my shepherd I shall not lack or want anything, why? Because like I was to my father’s sheep, more so is he to provide all that I need even beyond.
Here David outlines God’s ability to provide, comfort, heal, protect, guide, care for, be merciful, restore etc. David knew that if he being human could provide for his father’s sheep, God the creator could even do more and greater.
The question is: Is the Lord your Shepherd?
It is easy to say, but do you really believe that he is? If you are still trouble and wondering how you can or will make it, then I still want to ask, is the Lord your shepherd?
For the Lord to be your shepherd is not just by word of mouth, but it must be accompanied by action. What you do or say plays a greater part in knowing whether or not the Lord is your shepherd.
Notice David said, “I shall not want…” in other words, God is the manager of my affairs and he does not need my advice, so I don’t have to worry. If the Lord is your shepherd, then your confession must line up with your actions.
“I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep knows my voice…” (John 10:14). Do you know his voice if he is your shepherd?
For David he knew that just as his father’s sheep depended on him, more so was he depended on the Lord. It is the shepherd’s duty to concern himself with everything that concerns the sheep. The sheep depended on the shepherd for everything from security to provisions.
As outlined in our text above, here we see what the Good Shepherd is to us:
He is the SEEKING Shepherd to the sheep that is lost
He is the PROVIDING Shepherd to the sheep that is in need
He is the COMFORTING Shepherd to the sheep that is hurting
He is the HEALING Shepherd to the sheep that is bruised
He is the PEACEFUL shepherd to the sheep that is anxious
He is the GUIDING Shepherd to the wandering sheep
He is the PROTECTING Shepherd to the sheep that is fearful
He is the CARRYING Shepherd to the lame sheep
He is the FULFILLING Shepherd to the to the discounted sheep
He is the ANOINTING Shepherd to the parched or dried sheep
He is the REASSURING Shepherd to the sheep that is timid
He is the MERCIFUL Shepherd to the sheep that has fallen
He is the QUIETING Shepherd to the sheep that is nervious
He is the RESTFUL Shepherd to the sheep that is so heavy laden
He is the EVER-PRESENT Shepherd to the sheep is so lonely
He is the RESTORING Shepherd to the sheep that is weary
And he is the GOOD SHEPHERD to all His sheep.
Brothers and sister truly the Lord is our Shepherd and he can be whatever we want him to be. The choice is ours to accept him as our Shepherd and he will no doubt be to you what you want him to be.
In my own personal life as a missionary on the mission field, I have seen and continue to see the Lord as my Shepherd and have and continue experience the all of the above in my life and ministry. As the Good Shepherd he has been my help in ages past and he is no doubt my hope for years to come. Thank you Jesus the Shepherd of our souls.","prayer": "LORD MAY WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE THE TRUE SHEPHERD","ts": 2012-04-23 14:59:08}, {"id": 60,"dt": "","pastor": 3,"theme": "Glory","scripture": "Ephesians 1:1","reading": "Glory","bible": "Glory","devotion": "Glory","prayer": "Glory","ts": 2012-04-23 15:54:28}, {"id": 369,"dt": "","pastor": 100,"theme": "sssssssssssss","scripture": "Lamentations 1:1","reading": "s","bible": "s","devotion": "s","prayer": "s","ts": 2012-11-27 07:05:54}, {"id": 710,"dt": "","pastor": 412,"theme": "Pray for people suffering for Christ\'s sake.","scripture": "Hebrews 13:3","reading": "Continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering","bible": "NIV","devotion": "We should all earnestly remember men and women of God who are persecuted and even put to death for the sake of the gospel.

You honor God when you are productive each day and respect the people who are in authority over you. You honor God when you excel in your career.
Actions speak louder than words. When you give your very best in the workplace, your whole life is giving praise to God. Showing up with a good attitude, friendly, organized, being your best — people will notice there’s something different about you. They’ll want what you have.
As believers, we should set the standard in all areas of life. People should see the depth of your character and your spirit of excellence and know that you are a child of the Most High God.

If we fail to do that our spiritual life will come to a halt and that will inevitably lead to stagnation and regression. Every year you ought to know Christ better than you did the year before. You must carefully examine yourself to determine whether this is true of your life. Peter called upon the first Christians to \"increase\" in the grace and knowledge of Christ. We cannot do this by ourselves or by our own strength; That is why Christ gave us the Holy Spirit to guide us in the full truth - also the truth about Christ. While you gain in the knowledge and experience of God, His image becomes increasingly more visible in your life. This happens in your dedication as a Christian and in the way you surrender your life to the guidance of God\'s Holy Spirit. If you are a true disciple of God, the knowledge that your relationship with Christ has deepened through the years, will not lead to pride. As a matter of fact, you will always be aware of your shortcomings and sinfulness. Yet the very realization that you are imperfect, is a sign of growth in the grace and knowledge of Christ through the powerful workings of the Holy Spirit. The Word of God is usually the way by which the Lord transfers this knowledge into his believing children. By the working of His Holy Spirit, who interprets the Word for us. As you meditate on God\'s Word, the Holy Spirit will plant the Word deep into your Spirit as revelation (Rhema - The spoken Word of God).

He says here, \"if we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.\" First of all, we see that there is a big difference between living in the Spirit and walking in the Spirit. It is not possible for you to live in South Africa and not walk in South Africa, yet it is possible to live in the Spirit and not walk in the Spirit. Kt, how is this possible? When a person gets born-again, he/she comes into the Spirit, according to 2 Cor 5:17 \"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation...\" Christ is Spirit, therefore when you accept Him in your heart and make Him the Lord and Saviour of your life, you come into the Spirit, because Christ is Spirit! Now, being in the Spirit is the first step. The second step is walking in the Spirit! There are Christians who have accepted Christ in their hearts, meaning that they are in the Spirit; they go to church and they love God; Yet they do not walk in the Spirit. When I say they do not walk in the Spirit I mean they still do as the world does, during parties they drink beers with others who are not born-again, they still go out in the night to night clubs and taverns (they call it \'grooving\'), they are involved in sexual relationships, yet they are born-again and go to church every Sunday. The Apostle Paul had a clear revelation of such Christians, that is why he writes that \"if we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit!\" Come On! You are now in the Spirit, begin to also walk in the Spirit! Walking in the Spirit means doing according to God\'s Word and desiring to grow in the knowledge of Christ and also doing all it takes in order to know Him more. Pray to God the Father, and ask Him in the Name of Jesus to give you the desire to know Him more, ask Him to give you more hunger for Him so that you may find it easy to walk in the Spirit. Peter says in 1 Peter 1:14 \"Let us not allow our lives to be shaped by the desires we had when we were still in the dark.\" Don\'t allow old desires control your live now, you are now in the Spirit, you must now walk in the Spirit. Even if it means changing your friends in order to walk in the Spirit, then do it! Because some people cannot walk in the Spirit because of the kind of friends they have, they find it difficult to differ from their friends; Then the solution is to change those friends; You rather have Jesus as your only friend, than to have 1000 friends who will mislead you and swift you away from the Spirit life. Dear Friend, hear the voice of the Lord today. Abide in God\'s Word, your desire for God will grow.

Or who do you spend most time praying for? It is so much important that you learn to pray for others. It is good to pray for yourself and your success, but it is also crucial that you pray for others as well. Remember, prayer is not something we should use to place an order from God; Prayer should not be something done only with the intention of making requests known to God. Prayer should be more than that. Prayer should be fellowship with God. It should not only be about you telling God, it should also be about God telling you as well. Have you ever thought about someone during prayer? I know the answer is Yes! That thought of someone who just popped up in your mind during prayer, is the voice of God telling you to pray for that particular person. During prayer, it is very much important that you pray for others, because the prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective (James 5:16). There are some people who are depending on our prayers for victory. As we pray for others, God will begin to intervene in their lives and they will be able to breakthrough any situation.

His Spirit is not an \"it.\" He is not some impersonal power or force. The Spirit is God Himself, the third Person of the Trinity. The Spirit of the Lord is omniscient and knows everything the Father knows. He is omnipotent, was actively engaged in the creation of the universe, and still does miracles today. He is omnipresent and fills all space and time. There is no place where we can go to escape from the presence of God\'s Spirit (Psalm 139:7-12). When God wished to give power to chosen rulers, He filled them with His Holy Spirit. David is an example of this: \"From that day on the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon David\" (1 Samuel 16:13 NIV). It happened to Samson as well (Judges 14:6). God also sent His Spirit into the prophets to inspire them to speak His Words. Before He ascended to heaven, Jesus promised His disciples that He would send the Holy Spirit - not only to be with them, but to live in their very hearts (John 14:17). In the past, God had only sent His Spirit upon key people. With the birth of the Church, however, He promised to send His Spirit upon all believers. Jesus explained that \"the Spirit of truth\" testifies that He is the Saviour (John 15:26). In fact, the Holy Spirit is the one who causes us to experience a spiritual birth: \"the Spirit alone gives eternal life\" (John 6:63 NLT). When we become Christians, God sends His Spirit into our hearts to show that we belong to Him (Ephesians 1:13-14). The Holy Spirit also teaches us, comforts us, and gives us power to live the Christian life and to be a witness for Jesus (John 14:25-26; Acts 1:8).","prayer": "Dear Father, we thank you for the gift of the Holy Spirit in our hearts; We allow your Spirit to reign and rule in our lives, in Jesus\' Mighty Name...Amen!","ts": 2012-12-17 12:44:00}, {"id": 70,"dt": "","pastor": 6,"theme": "No secrets to those led by the Spirit","scripture": "1 Corinthians 2:9","reading": "But as it is written: \"Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man, The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.\" 10: But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit.

A mighty revelation just landed into my Spirit as I was meditating on 1 Cor 2:9-10. I quickly decided to switch on my laptop and record this revelation on Holiness Page, so that you may also learn something out of  it. There are no secrets to those who are led by the Spirit. The Word of God is so clear, that \"the Holy Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. Child of God, God is your Father, He is one with you. You are in Him and He is in you. Therefore, if God is in you, then His Holy Spirit is also in you, because God and His Spirit are one. This means that you are in the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is in you. Now, if the Holy Spirit searches even the deep things of God, this means that, those deep things of God (mysteries) have also been made known to you as well, because you are one with God. For many years I thought that 1 Cor 2:9 was referring to God\'s children: It says, \"Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man, The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.\" I used to think that this scripture is referring to us who are born-again; I used to think that God has a surprise for us which He would one day reveal. But today as I meditated on these to verses (1 Cor 2:9-10), I received the revelation that this scripture is not referring to us God\'s children. Let\'s break it down: 1. \"Eye has not seen\" - Which eyes have not seen? The eyes of those who are outside of God\'s Kingdom (who are not yet born-again and are still under the control of the kingdom of darkness). 2. \"Nor ear heard\" - Which ears have not heard? It is the ears of those who are not yet in Christ. 3. \"Nor have entered into the heart of man\" - Which hearts? Same answer: The hearts of those who are not yet in Christ! We are now in Christ, we are now one with God. God lives in us and we live in God. The Holy Spirit is now one with us. So, there is no way we cannot know what God knows. Whatever God knows, we now know because of the Holy Spirit. All that God has done for us, we now know because the Holy Spirit has revealed it to us. All the beautiful things God has done for us, we know them by His Spirit which searches all things, even the deep things of God! Hallelujah!

Nature is eagerly waiting for Sons of God, who will manage and control it and have dominion over it as was Adam. Nature is not happy with the curse upon it, it eagerly desires to be managed and controlled by Sons of God. According to Romans 8:20, nature did not choose to be under this curse, nature was happy to be under the control of the man God created, because this man was handling it according to God\'s purpose; yet nature was condemned, not of its own choice, but because God willed it to be so. BUT, God placed HOPE upon nature, that it would one day be set free from its slavery to decay and would share the glorious freedom of the Sons of God. Children cannot deliver nature from its curse, it is only Sons who can bring this deliverance to nature. The body of Christ is in need of Sons; Men and Women who function exactly like Jesus! Yes, we are born of God and are like Him; But being born of God and functioning like Him are two different things! Sons are those who are like God and also function like Him. Children are like God, but they have not yet tapped into His functionality. Children are those who are always asking for prayers (bear in mind: it\'s not wrong to ask for prayers), but Sons can change any situation at anytime. These are the ones which nature is longing for: \'Sons!\' Jesus is the best example of a Son. Nature was under His authority. He spoke to the sea and the sea became calm. This means the sea was so happy at that time to be managed by a \'Son\'. The fish in the sea will not swim into a trap, but because of the authority of Jesus, the fish were so happy to run into Peter\'s net. This is what nature is longing for: \'Sons!\' Abide in God\'s Word and grow in God to function as a Son!","prayer": "Father, please continue to give me great hunger for your Word!","ts": 2012-04-28 06:42:13}, {"id": 535,"dt": "","pastor": 38,"theme": "Trust Leads to Good Health","scripture": "Psalms 116:7","reading": "Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.","bible": "King James Version","devotion": "God has given you the gift of your body and it comes with an owner\'s manual - the Bible. In it are all the instructions you need to take care of yourself and live a long life.

You already know the basics - proper nutrition, exercise, a good night\'s rest. Today I want to look at the first of four health factors you may not have thought of for living long and well.

Trusting God is good for your health -- \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.\" (Proverbs 3:5 NIV) Why is trusting in God good for your health? When you trust Him then you don\'t worry.

Psalm 116:7 says, \"I said to myself, \"Relax, the Lord is going to take care of you\'\" (NCV). If you really trust in God, you\'re going to be less stressed.

You have a choice - You can either worry or worship. You can either pray or panic.

The more you pray, the less you\'ll panic. Relax, because God will take care of you!

The Bible says in Proverbs 14:30, \"A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones\" (NIV). It\'s not just what you eat that matters, it\'s what eats you. You can have all the right macrobiotics and organic food, but if your body is filled with resentment, worry, fear, lust, guilt, anger, bitterness, or any other emotional disease, it\'s going to shorten your life.

Do you know this Advocate, this Comforter? Not in an intellectual way, but by personal experience? Not only with your mind, but also with your heart?

What does it mean when a person is in Christ and walks according to the flesh? It means this person is now born-again, this person is a new creation, this person has accepted Christ in his/her heart, BUT this person still desires the things of the world, this person still speaks and behaves like the world, this person is still subject to his/her fleshly desires, this person still loves the things of the world; A person like this is a person who is in Christ, but walks according to the flesh!

Prisoners long for the freedom they have lost by their own doing. Those who are supposedly oppressed, use the word as their own gospel which eventually leads to a new kind of imprisonment. Many people think \"freedom\" is the right to do whatever you want, whenever you want. Anyone who tries to limit their freedom, is seen as an oppressor. Every form of discipline is opposed by intense rebelliousness. True freedom is infinitely more than a political or social aspiration. It is a deep spiritual experience that finds expression in a moral obligation. It is to do what you must do and not what you want to do. It is to become what God has intended you to be and not an image you have conjured up for yourself. You can only be truly free if you accept your responsibilities as a child of God. To consciously evade your responsibilities, is to be incarcerated in a dungeon of which you yourself were the architect. Eventually you are tortured by self-reproach, uncertainty and indecision. Freedom is an attitude of life. When Christ becomes the Lord of your life, you get to know the incomparable joy of having been liberated from the ties of sin. Fear is replaced by faith, hate by love and denigrating attitudes and thoughts make space for the freedom inspired by Jesus Christ. When Jesus controls your life by His Spirit, sin no longer has power over your thoughts and over your deeds, and you are free to serve Him in gratitude and with joy. Then your inheritance becomes a reality to you and you take the Saviour at His Word when He says: \"My peace I give unto you...\" Christ\'s promise that the children of God will, by His Spirit, receive the freedom that leads to peace, stands firm.","prayer": "Voice of God, prophetic Spirit, speak to every heart today to encourage or prohibit, urging action or delay; clear the vagueness which impedes us; enlighten our minds and souls; teach us the truth that makes us whole, In Jesus\' Name, Amen!","ts": 2012-04-29 20:45:02}, {"id": 77,"dt": "","pastor": 13,"theme": "The Spirit glorifies Christ","scripture": "John 16:14","reading": "He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you.","bible": "Beautiful Word - Dr. William Clington","devotion": "We cannot fully appreciate the work of the Holy Spirit if we do not fully understand and grasp His relationship with Jesus Christ.

The deepest longing of the disciples was to have Jesus with them continuously and permanently. Because He was aware of this sincere desire, He gave them the promise that the Holy Spirit would reveal Him to them in a very special way. It was a glorious promise of grace and it is still valid to every single follower of Jesus Christ today. Everything the Spirit receives from Christ, He will reveal to the children of God: His love, joy, peace - all that is of Him and can be a blessing to us! In the life of committed disciples, the Holy Spirit will continually, hour by hour every day, grant the strengthening presence of Jesus Christ. The Spirit then becomes a means to an end: He helps us to stay in communion with Jesus, get to know Him, love Him and serve Him better. The Holy Spirit does this work in silence, but with dynamic force.

It ought to be every Christian\'s aspiration to reach this goal. Many people shun this to their own spiritual detriment, and as a result, their relationship with God remains shallow. Some people reject it as being impractical because of the demands it poses, because it is completely impossible to live a holy life if your dedication to God is half-hearted. A truly holy person has completely surrendered his life to God and is impeccably obedient to Him. A holy walk with God demands that you are constantly aware of your attitudes, your deeds and your motives. As followers of the Lord, you have no excuse to persist in any sin. You cannot hold on to the world with one hand while reluctantly reaching out to God with the other. By doing this, you are only fooling yourself and you will never be able to walk the way of sanctification. We find directives for a holy life in God\'s Word.

It is precisely for moments like these that God gives us His Holy Spirit to fan the flames of hope in us. If you allow the Holy Spirit to guide you, it will be your deepest desire to do the will of God under all circumstances - even in a Gethsemane of blood and sweat. Initially it might be difficult, but by the power of the Holy Spirit working in you, you will be able to live to the glory of God. It needs courage not to do what you want to do, but to do what God wants you to do. A surprising by-product of obedience to the will of God, is that you gain self-confidence and a stronger faith. That is when you begin to live without fear and a feeling of inferiority. When the Holy Spirit guides you, you develop spiritual courage. Then you will agree with Robert Louis Stevenson who said that \"courage is not the absence of fear, but the victory over it.\" The key to this attitude towards life is fruit of the love that the Holy Spirit works in you.

We must prayerfully take this truth to heart every year God grants us. Christ says the world cannot receive Him because they do not know who He is. \"The world\" refers to those people who live as though there is no God, people who do not reckon with God when they plan their lives and look upon Him as irrelevant. There is no place for Him in their lives. They are so occupied with worldly things that they have no time or feeling for the things of the Spirit. That is why they became spiritually deaf and blind. What we do not use, will regress and die. Eventually, we see only the things that we have developed the ability to see: An astronomer will observe much more in the heavens than the ordinary man in the street; A botanist will see much more in a garden, than a person who has no knowledge of botany; A medical doctor will observe more by looking at a person than a mechanic would; an artist will read more in a painting than a person who has no knowledge of art; A musician will have more appreciation for a symphony than a person with no knowledge of music. What we see, hear and experience depend to a great extent on what we personally contribute to the experience. A person that bars God from his life, cannot experience the teaching of the Holy Spirit and this causes a void in his knowledge of God and of the Lord\'s powerful action in the lives of people. For that reason we must prayerfully, quietly and expectantly wait for the Holy Spirit to take possession of us. If we are so involved with the things of this world that there is no place for the Holy Spirit in our lives, we will not be able to share in the blessings that He longs to bestow on us lavishly. The Holy Spirit never breaks violently into our lives; He waits patiently to be received, as long as God\'s mercy is still available. Therefore you must take time in your busy life to wait quietly for the coming of the Holy Spirit. This is the only way you can receive the gift of God\'s Spirit in its fullness.","prayer": "Lord, I desire to know you more; Grow my understanding of your ways, and teach me by your Spirit how to walk in the Spirit!

You don\'t even have to be involved in everything in order for everything to favour you; Even without your presence or concern or input, things will automatically favour you! Even if the people who are planning new ideas do not know you, whatever they are planning will favour you greatly. Remember, God has a plan about your life: Jeremiah 29:11 \"For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope!\" Now, when you love God (loving God means living according to His Word), He is the one who makes sure that you are always at the right places at the right times!

Abraham did that. God promised him children \'...as numerous as the stars...\' (Genesis 22:17 NIV). Tired of waiting, he took matters into his own hands and fathered Ishmael with his wife\'s maidservant, Hagar. And that\'s when his troubles began in earnest. Now, God loved Ishmael and had great plans for him, but Abraham had to let go of him in order to fulfil God\'s will. It was one of the most painful experiences of Abraham\'s life. So:1) Refuse to let the enemy send anything into your life that will undermine what you have been waiting and praying for.2) Be careful who you take advice from. Fathering Ishmael was a \'good idea\' Abraham\'s wife Sarah had.3) Because you are willing to take responsibility for your actions, it doesn\'t mean that there won\'t be consequences, long-lasting ones! Be careful where you lie down; getting up again may not be as easy as you think.4) There are things you can give up effortlessly, and other things that will take every ounce of grace you have. And it\'s especially hard to give up something you\'re attached to and see yourself reflected in, like a job you love, a house you\'re living in, or a relationship you\'re tied to. But when you\'ve gone as far as you can with your \'Ishmael\' and you\'re ready to see God\'s promise fulfilled in your life, you must be willing to let it go.","prayer": "Father we thank for another day u hav given us, we choose to abide in ur will nd to wait upon ur promises.

When people see my likeness in my kids, it pleases me. God wants his children to bear his image and likeness, too. The Bible says, \"You were created to be like God, truly righteous and holy.\" (Ephesians 4:24 GW) Let me be absolutely clear: You will never become God, or even a god. That prideful lie is Satan\'s oldest temptation. Satan promised Adam and Eve that if they followed his advice, \"you shall be as gods.\" (Genesis 3:5 KJV) Many religions and new age philosophies still promote this lie that we are divine or can become gods. This desire to be a god shows up every time when we try to control our circumstances, our future, and people around us. God doesn\'t want you to become a god; he wants you to become godly -taking on his values, attitudes and character. We are meant to \"take on an entirely new way of life - a God-fashioned life, a life renewed from the inside and working itself into your conduct as God accurately reproduces his character in you.\" (Ephesians 4:22 MSG) God\'s ultimate goal for your life on earth is not to comfort, but character development.

What is amazing about this is that fighting (fighting with someone) is something which is totally wrong before the Lord, yet God tells us to fight the good fight of faith! Why does God refer to this fight as good? There are two reasons why God refers to this fight as \'good\'. Number 1: in this fight you are not fighting with anyone! LOL!!! Isn\'t that ironic? You are in a fight but you are not fighting against anyone. YES, it\'s true, in this fight you are not fighting anyone. Many Christians think that God says we should fight a good fight of faith against the devil. NO! We are not fighting with the devil; The devil has been totally defeated, Colossians 2:15 makes us aware that Jesus disarmed the kingdom of darkness and made a public spectacle of them, So there is no way we can still be fighting the devil because the devil has been TOTALLY defeated. Always keep it in mind that when God talks about us fighting a good fight of faith, He doesn\'t mean that we should fight with the devil, NO! The devil has been defeated, he has been disarmed, he is now left with NOTHING but a BIG mouth which is full of lies. Number 2: in this fight, the results/outcome is guaranteed from the very beginning. WOW! So the fight is predictable??? YES! You can easily tell the outcome of the fight. So, What exactly is a good fight of faith??? Fighting a good fight of faith means \'keeping what you have already received!\' It means \'protecting what already belongs to you!\' As God\'s Sons and Daughters, our battle is not to take, it is to keep! Remember, at the cross Jesus said these words \'it is finished\', and again remember the Word says we are \'joint heirs\' with Christ, meaning that whatever belongs to Christ also belong to us, and whatever has been given to Christ by the Father also was given to us! So the good fight of faith is standing in faith to keep and protect my inheritance as a Son or Daughter of God! It has got nothing to do with the devil. What I have to do is to abide in God\'s Word (John 8:31) so that I don\'t lose my identity in Christ; then be able to keep what is already mine! Child of God, stay in the Word, stay in meditation of God\'s Word, stay in prayer, stay in Love, This is what it really is to fight a good fight of faith! It is protecting/keeping/sustaining/growing/watering what is already yours. Stay Blessed!!!","prayer": "Dear Father, thank you for making me aware that I am blessed in all areas of my life, thank you that whatever belongs to Jesus Christ also belongs to me, thank you that I am a joint heir with Jesus Christ my brother!

You see! The power which God uses to do mighty things in our lives, is the power which is already at work in us. So, don\'t limit God, because in you there is power which God can use to do great and mighty things; So when you limit Him, you are actually preventing Him from accessing that power which is already in you. One of the things which the devil can use in order to cause you to limit God is \'fear\'. The bible says in 2 Timothy 1:7, \"For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind\". Fear can cause you to limit God; It can cause you to draw back from doing the great things which God has anointed you to do. Don\'t allow fear to take hold of you, God has not given you the spirit of fear; fear does not come from God, don\'t allow the devil to pull you down using fear; Whenever you feel the challenge of fear, Speak out and say: GOD HAS NOT GIVEN ME THE SPIRIT OF FEAR, HE HAS GIVEN ME THE SPIRIT OF POWER! According to God\'s Word, God does not want us to live ordinary lives; We should never limit Him, because He has invested so much power in us. Therefore, we ought to live extra ordinary lives, we ought to do great and mighty things, we ought to function in great power; What is impossible to others should be possible to us because of the great power which God has already imparted into us. Where the world fails, we ought to succeed, for we are born of God.

Your work is a test from God -- \"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much But if you have not been trustworthy with someone else\'s property, who will give you property of your own?\" (Luke 16:10-12 NIV)

God is watching what you do, even when no one else is -- \"Work hard so God can say to you, \"Well done.\' Be a good workman, one who does not need to be ashamed when God examines your work.\" (2 Timothy 2:15 LB)

Your attitude determines your joy -- \"The diligent find freedom in their work; the lazy are oppressed by work.\" (Proverbs 12:24 MSG)

When the Lord promises to make you the head, what it simply means is you will be the most important person around. It also means you will be indispensible. The tail on the other hand is so useless that the Lord did not even bother giving it to man. Inside the head are two eyes. There is a reason for two eyes. Ecclesiastes 4:9 says two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor. If one of the eyes is bad, the other can be used for vision. Another reason is that the second eye can confirm what the first eye has seen .Matthew 18:20 says out of the mouth of two or three the truth shall be established. The head is responsible for vision. According to Proverbs 29:18 where there is no vision, death is imminent.

Also in the head are two ears. There is a reason for two ears but I will touch that later. The ears are very important because Romans 10:17 says faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. What the head hears determines what will happen to the body. What the ear hears determines whether the body will be happy or not. As the head what are you hearing? There are many who are well informed when it comes to news and current affairs. They hear what the doctors have to say; they hear what the economist have to forecast; they hear what the news reporters have to report; they even listen to what the experts have to say about their situation but they have not taken time to check what the word of God is saying. Maybe I should take this opportunity to tell you that no matter what you are going through all will be well. How do I know this? Well the word of God says tell the righteous it shall be well with them,Isaiah 3:10. If you are righteous, be rest assured all will be well. What the head hears also determines the future of the body. How does one get a woman to marry him? It is not by looking at her and smiling. It is by saying things into the woman’s ear. What she hears will inform her decision to either agree or disagree to be your wife. To be head means I will hear the word of God that will increase my faith. It also means I will be hearing what God has to say. Revelations 2:7 says he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. Even if what God has to say is a rebuke, as the head you should be ready to hear that. Ecclesiastes 7:5 says it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. There is no one living who has no faults. We see the back of head of everyone; we need people to see the back of our heads too. We see the faults of others; we need others to see our faults too. As leaders we should be ready to listen when been corrected.
KEY WORD: I shall be the head simply means I will I hear the word of God that will increase my faith. Not only that I will be ready to hear what God has to say even if it is a rebuke.","prayer": "God help me to hear your word to become the head.","ts": 2013-03-29 14:02:18}, {"id": 96,"dt": "","pastor": 19,"theme": "Eternal Life - Knowing God in the Spirit","scripture": "John 17:3","reading": "And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.","bible": "LP Translation","devotion": "What is Eternal Life?

They argue that no one can think God exists and even be convinced that God exists, but at best skeptics argue that belief in God is a blind, illogical leap into the dark. But Christianity, as Paul explained to the Roman governor Festus, is a very reasonable faith. When Festus exclaimed, \"You are out of your mind!\" Paul replied, \"I am not insane....What I am saying is true and reasonable\" (Acts 26:25 NIV). It is reasonable because there is evidence. God created humankind and \"never left them without evidence of Himself\" (Acts 14:17 NLT). What is the evidence? The amazing, complex world around us and the universe above us. As Paul explained, the seasonal water cycles, the fertility of the earth, and the mystery of life itself are not only proof of God\'s existence, but also of His loving care. Modern biological sciences - particularly when one descends to the level of microbiology - confirm how breathtaking life is. The fingerprints of God are all over the plethora of earth\'s life forms. Their unique, complex, and interdependent designs are evidence that an intelligent designer made them. David also tells us, \"The heavens proclaim the glory of God. The skies display his craftsmanship\" (Psalm 19:1 NLT). We know the heavens to be far more awesome and astonishing than the ancients could possibly have imagined. Not only are the stars awe-inspiring and beautiful, but the universe - filled with galaxies, nebulae, red dwarfs, planets, moons, and black holes, not to mention the constant array of new discoveries - astounds us.

Even the universe itself, as ancient as it is, once had a spectacular inception. But God has neither beginning nor end. He is utterly beyond any frame of reference that we have or can even logically theorize about. We cannot begin to grasp the concept of an all powerful Being who lives for endless ages. We can only say like Job, \"How great is God - beyond our understanding! The number of His years is past finding out\" (Job 36:26 NIV).

A heart that seeks God\'s direction will be rewarded with guidance from Him because God does have a plan for each of us (Jer 29:11). Sometimes it takes effort and certainly patience to discover what that plan is, but if you truly look for it and wait for His guidance, it will come.

Nevertheless, many people are skeptical because miracles are not everyday occurrences. Generally, the world runs the way God set it up, with gravity tugging on our toes, the seasons changing, and sunrise and sunset happening like clockwork. A miracle by definition, defies the laws of nature. But God is capable of overriding His own existing laws to bring about new results. Take the parting of the Red Sea: the Bible states, \"The Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind\" (Exodus 14:21 NKJV), and when the Israelites crossed the sea bed, \"the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left\" (Exodus 14:22 NKJV). A few verses later, Moses, an eyewitness to the event, explained, \"The depths congealed in the heart of the sea\" (Exodus 15:8 NKJV). Congealed means \"hardened.\" That doesn\'t mean the water had frozen like ice, but it does mean something out of the ordinary was happening to the water to cause it to stand stiff like walls. God\'s normal laws of physics were responding to His awesome power. It would be nice if we could always understand how miracles happened; but whether we can or not, in both the Old and New Testaments, multitudes of witnesses saw them happen. Jesus repeatedly performed miracles in front of crowds of thousands (John 6:2). When He healed a blind, mute man \"all the multitudes were amazed\" (Matthew 12:23 NKJV). What\'s more, when Peter told the crowds that Jesus had done miracles, he confidently stated, \"You yourselves know this\" (Acts 2:22 NIRV). Indeed they did. After Peter and John healed a lame man, even their exasperated enemies confessed, \"We can\'t deny that they have performed a miraculous sign, and everybody in Jerusalem knows about it\" (Acts 4:16 NLT).","prayer": "Thank you Lord for this fresh teaching about MIRACLES!","ts": 2012-05-09 06:37:29}, {"id": 108,"dt": "","pastor": 25,"theme": "The Big Open Door","scripture": "1 Corinthians 16:9","reading": "For a wide door of opportunity for effectual[service] has opened to me[there, a great and promising one], and [there are] many advesaries.","bible": "The Amplified Bible","devotion": "God has already provided salvation, victory, joy, peace,hope through Christ Jesus.

It connects you to another person when you give in order to make their life better. Jesus said that real love is shown when a person lays down his life for a friend - that\'s the ultimate in giving.

He paid his fare and went abroad with the crew to sail to Spain. But the Lord sent a strong wind on the sea, and the storm was so violent that the ship was in danger of breaking up. Finally, Jonah went on to tell the sailors that he was actually running away from the Lord. The sailors then asked him, \"what do we do then to stop the storm?\" Jonah answered, \"Throw me into the sea, and it will calm dowm, for it is my fault that you are caught in this violent storm............Now let me talk to you: You\'ve just blown it...again.

He gave sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and even raised the dead back to life. Many Jews had no idea that the Messiah, when He came, would do such things - but the scriptures had clearly foretold that He would (Isaiah 29:18; 35:5-6; 42:7). When John the baptist began questioning whether Jesus was the promised Messiah, Jesus sent this message back with John\'s disciples: \"Go and tell John the things which you hear and see: the blind see and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up\" (Matthew 11:4-5 NKJV). Jesus fully expected that John would understand that these miracles were proof that He was the Messiah. These things (miracles) were part of Jesus\' ministry for two reasons: First, they proved that God had given power to Jesus. When Jesus healed a blind man, His religious enemies cross-examined the man, insisting that Jesus was a sinful, godless person. The formerly blind man wisely replied, \"Since the world began it was not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing\" (John 9:32-33 KJV). Jesus\' astonishing miracles were proof that He was the Messiah. From the beginning of Jesus\' ministry, \"many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did\" (John 2:23 KJV). The second reason that Jesus did healing miracles was that He cared for people. In a day when so many were sick and doctors so few and their skills so limited, healing power clearly demonstrated God\'s love for them.","prayer": "Dear Jesus, thank you for your love which you have revealed unto us all!","ts": 2012-05-12 06:15:34}, {"id": 116,"dt": "","pastor": 15,"theme": "Grace","scripture": "Nehemiah 1:1","reading": "Grace","bible": "Holy","devotion": "Grace","prayer": "Grace","ts": 2012-05-15 06:13:29}, {"id": 375,"dt": "","pastor": 38,"theme": "Why Tarry (Wait) for The Holy Spirit?","scripture": "Luke 24:49","reading": "And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.","bible": "King James Bible (Cambridge Ed.)","devotion": "First of all, there came a time when the disciples of Jesus Christ had to tarry (meaning: wait) for the Holly Spirit to come and fill them, so they could then move and go to the ends of the earth; preaching the Gospel and demonstrating the Power...

The head simply means the leader, captain; one in charge e.t.c. The head bears a lot of responsibility because inside the head is the brain responsible for making decisions. Inside the head are two eyes. For the head to function properly, it needs good eyes. Luke 11:34 says the light of the body is the eye; therefore when thine is single, thy whole body is full of light. Without good eyes, the whole body will be in darkness. Matthew 6:23 says if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. The eye is an organ of vision. Therefore the head is responsible for vision. Proverbs 29:18 says where there is no vision, the people perish. When we talk of vision, we mean spiritual vision i.e. seeing things the way God will sees them. The question is how does God see sin? He sees all sins as sin , there is no big sin or small sin ; all sins are sin. To be head means I will see sin as a sin i.e. I will see a lie as a sin not a white lie or blue lie. How does God see commitment to Him? Revelations 3:15 says I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. To God you either cold or hot, lukewarmness is an abomination to Him. To be the head means I will be very hot for the Lord. Spiritual vision also means following after the direction of God. To be the head means I will guide the people aright i.e. in the way of righteousness. When you say I shall be the head, what you are saying is that I will lead people in the part of righteousness.There are several advantages of having a good vision or seeing things the way God sees them. One of it is one begins to see his or herself surrounded by opportunities. In 2 Kings 4:1-7 is the story of a woman in big debt. She had a small jar of oil and was surrounded by people with empty vessels. She was surrounded by opportunities but could not see it. She ran to the man of God and that one asked her what she had. She said she had nothing except a jar of oil. Because the man of God could see, he told her she was surrounded with vast number opportunities i.e. there are other people around her with empty vessels. He told her to go and borrow the empty vessels and pour her oil in them; their poverty will make her rich. An individual who sees things the way God sees them will see the need of the people around and from the need of the people become prosperous. The individual will see a need for a service or goods around him, and from providing the goods or service he will become rich. Another advantage is one begins to see a way where there is no way. When the children of Israel saw Goliath, they saw an unbeatable champion, 1 Samuel 17:20-58. Actually they saw challenging Goliath to a fight as suicide. When David came to the scene, he not only saw that Goliath was beatable,he saw that his head could actually be severed from his body too. He aimed at his unprotected skull and immediately Goliath fell, he took his huge sword and cut off his head.

Just as God had warned, they died spiritually, and we inherited their proclivity to sin. The Bible states, \"The soul who sins shall die\" (Ezekiel 18:20 NKJV). God, however, longed for His people to repent so He could forgive them. He allowed them to substitute a sacrificial animal so they didn\'t have to die. This act of obedience demonstrated their acknowledgement of guilt, their repentance, their request for forgiveness, and their dependence upon the mercy of God. As the blood drained out of the sacrifice, it died and the price was paid. The blood of the sacrificial animal made \"atonement\" - which means \"to cover\" their sins - and God then forgave them. \"The life of the flesh is in the blood\" (Leviticus 17:11), and \"without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\" (Hebrews 9:22 NIV). HERE\'S THE CORE OF MY MESSAGE: However, the blood of sacrificial animals could never permanently atone for sin. People kept having to return with a new sacrifice to cover new disobediences. So God made one final sacrifice to forgive all our sins once and for all. He sent His only Son, Jesus, to die in our place. Jesus\' lifeblood drained out of His body as the ultimate sacrificial offering, and \"the blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from all sin\" (1 John 1:7 NIV).

First John 3:9 is often used to support this doctrine: \"Whoever has been born of God does not sin\" (NKJV). If anyone sins - even in tiny ways - they believe that this proves they were never saved to begin with. They also note that Jesus told us to be \"perfect\" just as God is perfect (Matthew 5:48). However, it should be pointed out that the Greek word translated here as \"perfect\" means \"complete,\" not sinless. But most Christians believe that a doctrine of complete sinlessness is unrealistic and, more importantly, goes against the overwhelming evidence of scripture. They point out that God has declared that our righteousness before Him is a divine gift imputed to us (credited to our account) because of our faith in Jesus Christ - even though we are weak, imperfect people (Romans 4:21-25). When God looks at us, He doesn\'t see our lack of righteousness, but the righteousness of Christ whose blood washes away our sins. Jesus told his disciples to forgive a brother who kept on sinning and sinning against them (Matthew 18:21-22), evidence that believers aren\'t exempt from sin. John makes this plain when he writes, \"These things I write to you, so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ\" (1 John 2:1 NKJV). Here John advised Christians to do their best to obey God and not to sin, but stated that if they did sin, to repent and turn to God for forgiveness - and yes, God would forgive them. \"Well then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace? Of course not!\" (Romans 6:1-2 NLT). So, there\'s still forgiveness after Salvation, Praise the Lord for His Mercies which endure forever.","prayer": "Dear Father, I thank you for the forgiveness and righteousness which I have received by your Grace.

Most Jews in Jesus\' day expected the Messiah to be a great warrior king who would deliver them militarily from their oppressors and then set up His kingdom. David had been Israel\'s king a thousand years earlier, and God had promised that his kingdom would endure forever (2 Samuel 7:16). But now Israel had no king and was ruled by foreigners.

We must set our minds on the things of the Spirit and not live according to our fleshly desires. The more we walk in the Spirit, will be the more our flesh will be impacted by the Spirit.

If you follow that negative feeling, you will be walking in the flesh, and the bible says we cannot please God in the flesh.

And many of us may know and remember the great stories of young people in the Bible that had such remarkable stories and results in their youth and great impact in their worlds. The youth such as the great David, who became the great king of Israel and a man after God\'s own heart (Acts 13:22), Elihu, in the book of Job -- the youth that had so much of wisdom and the audacity to make elders listen, when he shared \'divine prudence\' with them (Job 32:2-6), the bold and persuaded Jonathan, son of Saul, that dared so much;  the visionary Joseph, Gideon, who led the army of Israel to many great victories, Samuel, who listened to the voice of God still young and Jesus, of course, and many others etc.

You (and I) can do it too! There\'s nothing new under the sun. Same yesterday, today and forever is God.

Youth is not just, \"...the time of life between childhood and adulthood (maturity)\" as according to Wikipedia; youth is a precious gift  that God could ever give a man and mean so much to Him.

God has given us as young people so much of potential, and we need to urgently realize that. Because, in the first place:
1. being young is a gift;
2. youth is a greatest tool of change and hope; and
3. young people are the main \'targets\' in society...

Youth, then, is the most impressionable age, so THIS MUST BE THE BEST TIME FOR YOU (AND ME) TO KNOW GOD AND HIS WAYS, and be like David when he is old and says, \"...it was good to know the LORD in my youth.\"

In conclusion, therefore young people do not lose heart and faint in your walk of faith with God in your youth, seek, more than anything else, a relationship with God and to know God.

God Bless You so much

But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.\"","bible": "NKJV","devotion": "When Jesus told a rich ruler that he needed to obey the commandments to enter into life, the man professed that he\'d always kept all of the Ten Commandments faithfully. But when Jesus put him to the test by asking him to give up his riches and follow Him, the man refused. Jesus then explained to His disciples that it is difficult for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God. The disciples then asked, \"Who then can be saved?\" And Jesus replied, \"With man this is impossible\" (Matthew 19:25-26 NIV). He didn\'t answer that only very good people entered heaven. He said it was impossible for anyone to do so. Why? Because no one is truly good. However, Jesus added that with God all things are possible. God can make a way where there is no way. Yet Jesus had said, \"Keep the commandments\" - so which ones then, if not the Ten Commandments? Jesus later stated that the two greatest commands were to love God with all our hearts and to love our neighbor as ourselves (Matthew 22:35-40). The Apostle Paul said that those who obey these commands have fulfilled God\'s law (Romans 13:8; Galatians 5:14). But remember that it\'s impossible for even the ones who try to keep God\'s commands, to be saved. So who can be saved??? Jesus told the religious leaders that tax collectors and prostitutes were entering the Kingdom of God ahead of them (Matthew 21:31). How could \"sinners\" find eternal life before \"good\" people? Because the sinners repented of their sins and trusted in Jesus to save them. John summed up God\'s law by saying, \"And this is His commandment, That we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another\" (1 John 3:23 KJV). We must believe in Jesus and, by His power, live a life of love.

Being in Christ and walking according to the flesh means that you are born-again, but you still desire the things of the world, you still do the things done by those who have not yet accepted Christ, you still carry the worldly behavior and the attitude of those who are not born-again, but in actual fact you are born-again and are in Christ. The part for \"no condemnation\" refers to those who are in Christ and walk according to the Spirit. Walking according to the Spirit means desiring the things of the Spirit, it means doing all things according to God\'s Word and setting the Word of God as the standard of your life. So if you are in Christ and you still live according to the flesh, then you are heading towards condemnation because those who are in the flesh cannot please God (Rom 8:8). God is Spirit, so you cannot please Him unless you are in the Spirit. The only way in which you can remain in the Spirit is by abiding in the Word. The Word of God is the only way to Spiritual growth and maturity, there is no other way.

Throughout the Bible, on many occasions, we\'re introduced to \'new\' relationships with God and these relationships are more and more revealed to us; so we understand them better.

Remember, for the first time, when the Bible [WORD of God] reveals to us how Jesus is \"a friend who sticks closer than a brother...\" - that’s a relationship; a very special relation dynamic between Jesus and us (the Church). Now, throughout the Bible, the Bible discloses relationships we can have with God and now even as our Father! Hallelujah!

But I want to particularly share a devotion specific to a man-and-wife relationship, and with the hope of regenerating some of the essence of this according to the WORD of God.

Our reading scripture above, from the book of Ephesians, clearly gives us a model of courtship or, even more so, marriage. We are let to understand a couple of things which form the foundation of a successful and, I would say, wise marriage. And let\'s look at these couple of things together:
1. As our mutual obligation, we ought to love each other (man and woman (or wife)) as Christ loves the Church. WOW! Alright the key thing here is to primarily understand what does \"loving your wife (or husband) as Christ loves the Church mean. And secondly, “how does Jesus love the Church?” IT IS ALL THERE...
2. The thing which most of the brothers or men out there confuse and use to their own “narrow interests” is the part of \"submission\".
Note that the Bible, before verse 22, in verse 21 says, \"SUBMIT TO ONE ANOTHER out of reverence for Christ.\" So, not necessarily wives only must submit, but both constituencies in the relationship. And of course, this is to avoid domineering over the other party and so forth, as some men are in fact doing out there to suppress their counterpart.
3. Love her (or him), as you love yourself. Because Christ loves the Church (His bride) as He loves himself too. Many are times the WORD of God emphasises this mere fact that when you marry you become as one and one body with your counter…

Every Christian or believer in Christ must have a defining moment in their lives. Many people live a life of control and manipulation, but yet there is something in them that God sees worthy of redeeming.
It does not matter how bad you may be, there is something inside of you that sees and cannot let die.
 A Defining Moment is:
1.	The point at which the essential nature or character of a person is revealed or identified.
2.	A very crucial moment
Climax, decisive moment, loaded moment, moment of truth, point of no return, turning point.
3.	It is that one moment in your life that changes everything.
Our text is about the story of Jacob in which he tricked his father in getting the birth right instead of his brother Esau. Jacob is about to meet is brother after long years of separation.
Here Jacob assumes his brother Esau is going to kill him supposedly for tricking his father to get his brother’s birth right. Jacob cleverly sends gifts ahead to his brother as a peace offering and spends the rest of the night in prayer asking God to spare his and his family life.
Though Jacob’s life was characterized by control and manipulation, yet there was something in him that God found worthy of redeeming. Jacob no doubt had a heart that genuinely wanted to serve God and be used of God. This genuine desire was being hindered by traits in his life and God had to do something to chisel this bad traits. 
To take away the bad traits in Jacob’s life, God sends an Angel in the form of a man to wrestle away the striving in him.  God will wrestle away from your life that one thing that will hinder your walk with him if you let him.
The only way God could remove the striving in Jacob was to injure his physical abilities. God will injure your physical abilities in order to remove the striving or bad traits within you.
Notice when the Angel saw that he could not overpower Jacob, he touched the socket of his hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. (Gen.32:25-26)
Jacob’s natural abilities were so great that God literally had to make him a weaker man physically in order for God’s power to be manifested in his life. This was the “Defining Moment” in Jacob’s life.
A new nature was birthed in him that required a total trust in God, erasing the old nature of control and manipulation. His name was changed in recognition of this “Defining Moment.”-
“Then said the man, your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with man and have overcome.”(Gen. 32:28).
I am skeptical of any Christian who does not walk with a limp. A limp Christian is the one who has wrestled with God and had his natural abilities injured and has come to a place of total dependence on God.
On the contrary a Christian who has not wrestled with God and natural abilities injured and has not come to a place of total dependence on God, will live a life of striving and manipulation. They are the same person.
For you to experience your defining moment in your life you will need to let go and let God do the work for you.
Your defining moment is that Moment of Truth, the Loaded Moment, the Decisive Moment.
Your defining moment is that point at which your true nature or character is revealed or identified. It is showing who you really are.
When Jacob encountered and wrestled with the Angel, he was wrestling with his destiny and thus discovered his Defining Moment.
You too like Jacob can discover your Defining Moment. You can discover that moment when everything suddenly changes for you.
To experience the Defining Moment of your life, you must:
1.	Have a heart to serve God
2.	Be desperate to see your situation change
3.	Understand that is interested in you
4.	Co-operate with God.
This could be your defining moment!!!!!!!","prayer": "LORD BRING EACH ONE OF US TO A DEFINING MOMENT IN OUR LIVES.","ts": 2012-06-11 20:51:53}, {"id": 167,"dt": "","pastor": 48,"theme": "Know Him and the power of His resurrection!!! (Part 2)","scripture": "Philippians 3:10","reading": "\"That I may know him,and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings,being made confortable unto his death.","bible": "KJV","devotion": "The resurrection of Jesus Christ is 
the standard of power in the New Testament. 
What is there after that? ... It is the miracle of miracles! I don\'t think an Easter Sunday goes by, indeed it does not, in that I am not reminded of just a little phrase from an old hymn: \"Today he rose and left the dead, and Satan\'s empire fell.\" Sometimes I hear people say: \"Lord, destroy the work of the devil.\" He has already destroyed the work of the devil! 
The proof, the standard of God\'s power in the New Testament is the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. The standard of God\'s power in the Old Testament was the deliverance of the people of Israel through the Red Sea which brought them finally into the land of promise. In the Old Testament the miracle is the raising of a dead nation, because they were in captivity, in Egypt, which is a type of the world. They were under the dominion of Pharaoh, which is a type of the devil, and they were brought as the Word of God says, \"God called them with a strong hand. He delivered them with a strong hand and a stretched out arm.\" 
All the way from Moses to Malachi there is a constant referring to \"Look what God did when He delivered Israel.\" Now, is anything bigger than that? Have you got a problem bigger than that? Can you imagine anything that demands on God more than that? So,
     He delivered them.
           He brought them out of captivity.
               He snapped their fetters, and 
                     He led them by His own hand and His own arm. 
In the New Testament the standard miracle, the standard of God\'s power, is the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Then, because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, there is of course the resurrection of the individual from the dead. We are told so again and again. Ephesians 2 for instance says: \"You have been quickened who were dead in trespasses and in sins.\" Now, he does not say that we will die. He says that we were dead. And the same miracle power that raised up Jesus from the dead is the power that raised us up from the dead.
You know, I don\'t think it put any strain on God to make the world. He just created it. It did not put any strain on God to create light. He just spoke the word and said: \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. But I am going to suggest to you that in a sense it put a strain on God to raise Jesus from the dead. In the sense that it tells us in Ephesians what is \"the exceeding greatness of His power to us all who believe according to the working of His mighty power when He wrought in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and set as His own right hand in heavenly places.\" There is an awful lot of energy there! He says: \"the exceeding greatness.\" You see, there are measures of God\'s power exerted through the Word of God. Sometimes a thing doesn\'t even cost God as much power as others. But it says here: \"the exceeding greatness of His power towards us who believe according to the working of His mighty power which He WROUGHT in Christ when He raised Him from the dead.\" 
There was a very tragic thing happened during the past week. A young couple with a very beautiful child discovered the child was missing. Sounded an alarm. Eventually they received a phone call to say that the child will be returned unharmed for JUST a couple of million dollars. The child happened to be the grandchild of one of the great tycoons in South America. A man who has made multi-millions of dollars out of tins. Immediately contact was made with him and of course he got everybody stirred up about this awful tragedy that happened in Europe. A child had been stolen. The demand was two million dollars. He said: \"We\'ll pay it.\" Now, do you think it took any energy for that man to reach over and take his check book and, having ten million dollars just write out a check for two million dollars? That demands no energy, only to write the check. But what I am going to suggest is that there was nothing in writing the check. There were awful anxieties and problems in his spirit, in his mind, everything was tormenting him. When he thought about all the possibilities that there were in getting that child back.
To interpret that this way: God said, \"let there be light,\" and there was light. But I don\'t think He said, \"let there be Calvary,\" and there was Calvary. You are dealing here with moral and spiritual principles. You are dealing with powers of darkness. Now, Jesus Christ was a Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. And I think again that we forget so much of the agony of the Father from the time Jesus left the ivory palaces to come into a world of woe. The loneliness was on the behalf of the Father, because He had no one in heaven with whom He could communicate. And He sees His Friend going there to the cross. His Son is going to bear the whole sin of the whole world. There is only one way to do it ... as the hymn writer says: \"Thou didst not spare Thine only Son, but gavest Him for a world undone.\" But you see, Calvary is the expression of the love of God.
Calvary expresses the love of God.
The resurrection explains the power of God. 
You think about all the colossal Epistles that Paul has written. He\'s got the most amazing track record of any man that has ever lived outside of Jesus: 
      He has raised the dead,
           he has opened the eyes of the blind,
                he has cast out demons,
                     he has written more epistles than all the other men put together.
      AND YET HE SAYS: \"I WANT TO KNOW HIM.\" 
It isn\'t that he does not know Him; he says there is a fuller revelation of Him. I\'ve been thinking about this text for a few days. Then I read a letter from an old friend - he is 96 years old now - and it just fits right in with what I had been thinking. He said, \"Ravenhill, I have been thinking about that word where Paul says \'That I may know Him and the POWER of His resurrection.\' Now look,\" he said, \"for sixty years I\'ve been trying to fathom that, but I do not understand the mystery of it. There is something there I can\'t unearth.\"
It reminded me of when we were in Ireland. There was a little godly man by the name of Busby in a town called Dungannon. He was a strange character for sure; that is why he liked me, because we were both strange. He had a marvelous ministry of prayer and healing. One day we went to his little house, it wasn\'t much more than a shack, and he said: \"Well, I\'ve got it, I\'ve got it.\" \"You got what?\" \"Remember I told you there is no water around here?\" He had started digging a well four feet in diameter. It was a heart breaking job, but he is a muscular man. He had been a weight lifter, though he was only about five feet high he had a tremendous physique. He went down fourteen feet and then he came to a slab of rock. As hard as any rock you ever saw in your life. And his friend said: \"Well, Smarty, there you are. What are you going to do now?\" He said: \"Shift the rock. It\'s a plug. And when I pull that plug the water is going to come.\" He just turned that rock on one side and water poured out. He could hardly get out of the well fast enough.
You know, when I read what my old friend said I thought: that\'s right. There is something in this word resurrection that as yet we have not fathomed. There is a plug here if you like, we\'ve got to lift it and discover what there is lying underneath it.
Look again at Paul. Man I would be intoxicated with joy if I had a ministry like it. I get people sometimes who say: \"You wrote me a letter; it turned my life around.\" Well, I thank God I can be His servant in that... But Paul has written letters that turned millions of lives around.
      Starving people have gone to his epistles and found strength.
           Thirsty people have gone and found something to drink.
                The weak have gone and found energy in them.
                     The hopeless have gone and found hope.","prayer": "Lord help us to know you and the power of your resurrection,as your word declares that the same spirit that raised you from death should dwell in us,thank  you  Lord for your resurrection power in us...Amen","ts": 2012-06-14 07:10:57}, {"id": 163,"dt": "","pastor": 15,"theme": "\"Giving\" - A symbol of Love","scripture": "John 3:16","reading": "For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son; that whoever believes in Him may not die/perish, but have everlasting life.","bible": "God\'s Mighty Book","devotion": "God loved the world and He gave.

The word of God continue to encourage us that “there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus” Romans 8:1. It means that we are already approved by God through our being in His son, Jesus the Messiah. While no-one is perfect enough to escape hell, and none is good enough to receive a smile from God, who is all holy, all perfect and all glorious; we know that Jesus is the only one who pleased the Father.

Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Draw near to God and He will draw near to you” (James 4:7-8 NASB). Submission to the Lord is a special way of drawing near to God. When a believer submits to God they are choosing to draw close to Him in obedience and full surrender as Jesus did in the garden of Gethsemane. We are in essence making Him not just Saviour but Lord of our lives. 
Personal time alone with God. Whenever we set apart time to spend alone with God we are purposely drawing near to God. Jesus made this a priority in His life as our example. “And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed” (Mark 1:35 KJV). This should be a daily practice of every born again believer. “The one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked” (1 John 2:6 NASB). Let’s spend daily time drawing near to Him! 
Practicing His presence. We draw near to God by constantly practicing God’s presence. “He Himself has said, I WILL NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU” (Hebrews 13:5 NASB). Jesus said, “I am with you always, even to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:20 NASB). His promise is that He will always be with us. It is incumbent upon us to constantly acknowledge and conscientiously dwell on His presence. In doing so we are drawing near Him. 
Fellowship. “Where two or three have gathered together in My name, I am there in their midst” (Matthew 18:20 NASB). When we gather together with those of like precious faith, He is there with us. We know He is always with us but His presence is in our midst in a special way when we gather in His name. John wrote, “No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us” (1 John 4:12 NASB). If God resides in every believer, it stands to reason His presence would be magnified the more of us are assembled as one in His name.","prayer": "Father of our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ help us never to forget the assembling of the saints,and help us to build one another as often as we come together to seek your face,this is the only way we can enjoy healing in our houses,temples and cities as  your word declares in 2 Cronicles 7:14 Amen.","ts": 2012-06-12 05:55:11}, {"id": 159,"dt": "","pastor": 48,"theme": "Know Him and the power of His resurrection!!!","scripture": "Philippians 3:10","reading": "\"That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;\"","bible": "KJV","devotion": "Philippians the third chapter and verse ten: \"That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;\"
There are obviously four statements in this verse:
      First, \"that I may know Him.\"
           Second, \"and the power of His resurrection.\"
                Third, \"the fellowship of His suffering.\"
                     Fourth, \"being made conformable unto His death.\" 
Paul is writing here to the saints at Philippi. Philippi was named by Alexander the Great for his father, Philip. We are told that this was really the birth place of the Roman Empire because of a battle fought here and won. But Paul is considering in this epistle something infinitely greater than any perishing empire of men.
It is wonderful, to me anyhow, that here is this aged man... battlescarred and worn, but notice his prayer:
      his aspiration never dies
           his vision never becomes dim, 
                the fever on his spirit never, in any way, got dull
     He does not pray to be released from prison... he might have done that.
     He does not pray even that he might have a ministry here... though I am sure he      aspired to that.
     He does not pray that his body may be healed... I am sure that though he was not      diseased, he was possibly terribly weak by the suffering he\'d endured.
     His aspiration is this: First, that I may know Him.
Usually the text gets that weight put on it: That I may know him, and sometimes, the other part: The power of His resurrection.
Now, there is no question, at least in my mind, about this: 
The resurrection of Jesus Christ is 
the standard of power in the New Testament.","prayer": "Father of our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ,bring us to a point to know you and the power of your resurrection,it is all about your power Lord we cannot do anything without you power.","ts": 2012-06-12 07:00:02}, {"id": 168,"dt": "","pastor": 48,"theme": "Happy father\'s day!","scripture": "Psalms 115:3","reading": "We are trying to configure a God who is just a little bigger than a man.","bible": "KJV","devotion": "If we are asked to describe God, we may come out with words such as omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent before saying how He loves us, forgives us, cares and provides for us, etc. Perhaps many Christians relate more to God\'s character such as His love and grace, than to His essential being in terms of being almighty, etc. Otherwise how is it that some find it difficult to actually believe the supernatural things the Bible reports He has done? Do we find it hard to believe that God could create the world and everything in it as the Bible says? Or that He destroyed the world through a flood? That He actually parted a sea and stopped a river from flowing? That He stopped the sun for about a day for Joshua? That He can heal the sick with a word and raise people from the dead? Etc. 
There is nothing wrong in seeking to find detailed explanations of how He did things. We are happy when scientific or archaeological discoveries corroborate the Bible. But when we try to find out natural explanations so as to avoid having to believe that He did anything supernatural, we are actually catering to unbelief in God as God. In other words, instead of believing in God who created everything out of nothing, who created all the laws of nature which we are only discovering little by little, and who has the ability to outperform those laws temporarily for any reason (Ps.115:3), we are trying to configure a god who is just a little bigger than a man. 
If someone discovers Noah\'s ark, that is great. But if no ark is found, will it shatter our faith in God? Do we need NASA\'s computers to tell us that there is a missing day in history when God made the sun to stand still? (Incidentally, this NASA story is a hoax.) Why is it difficult for us to believe that God can easily pause all planetary and stellar movements for some time and resume normal operations afterwards? Can\'t He stop the earth from rotating, without everything on the surface being thrown off because of the momentum? How almighty do we think our God is? 
The sad fact is that if we cannot believe in a really almighty God, it is also difficult to believe everything about His character. How can we be sure He will keep His promises? How can we believe He hears our prayers even if all the billions of people in the world are praying at the same time? How can we believe He knows the number of hairs on each one of our heads, and also what is happening in every cell in our bodies, what we are thinking of every moment, our motives and intentions, etc? How can we believe He can turn around for our good everything that happens to us?

Do we find it hard to believe that God could create the world and everything in it as the Bible says? Or that He destroyed the world through a flood? That He actually parted a sea and stopped a river from flowing? That He stopped the sun for about a day for Joshua? That He can heal the sick with a word and raise people from the dead? Etc. 
There is nothing wrong in seeking to find detailed explanations of how He did things. We are happy when scientific or archaeological discoveries corroborate the Bible. But when we try to find out natural explanations so as to avoid having to believe that He did anything supernatural, we are actually catering to unbelief in God as God. In other words, instead of believing in God who created everything out of nothing, who created all the laws of nature which we are only discovering little by little, and who has the ability to outperform those laws temporarily for any reason (Ps.115:3), we are trying to configure a god who is just a little bigger than a man. 
If someone discovers Noah\'s ark, that is great. But if no ark is found, will it shatter our faith in God? Do we need NASA\'s computers to tell us that there is a missing day in history when God made the sun to stand still? (Incidentally, this NASA story is a hoax.) Why is it difficult for us to believe that God can easily pause all planetary and stellar movements for some time and resume normal operations afterwards? Can\'t He stop the earth from rotating, without everything on the surface being thrown off because of the momentum? How almighty do we think our God is? 
The sad fact is that if we cannot believe in a really almighty God, it is also difficult to believe everything about His character. How can we be sure He will keep His promises? How can we believe He hears our prayers even if all the billions of people in the world are praying at the same time? How can we believe He knows the number of hairs on each one of our heads, and also what is happening in every cell in our bodies, what we are thinking of every moment, our motives and intentions, etc? How can we believe He can turn around for our good everything that happens to us?

How is the value of life decided?
The value of the object is not decided by itself, but is decided in relationship with the subject. Therefore the value of man is not decided by how long he lives, or how hard he works, but is decided by for whom or for what he lives and for whom and for what he dies.
There are three kinds of people:
There are those who are told it would have been better if they were never born, like Judas Iscariot. There are other examples: tyrants ad infamous men and women throughout history whose death left those around them relived and happy
There are those who gave neither good nor bad influence. When they die, they are forgotten very soon.
How about Jesus? His life was filled with miseries and distress, and sufferings. To the eyes of men, he was a most miserable person. However, even though he was crucified and his flesh perished, he still lives in the hearts of men. Millions of people could die for him, even now. Why?
It is not only because he came as a Son of God. It was also that he was born, he lived, and he lived, and he died for the sake of God and mankind. God is eternal. The value of Jesus’ life, who totally dedicated himself for God and mankind, never perished. His physical life was not any different from ours. He was tired after hard work, he was hungry when he didn\'t eat, and he was thirsty when he didn\'t drink. Even though Jesus’ physical body perished on the cross, the value of his life is absolute and eternal. Jesus has been a shining light to the world for these past 2,000 years.

Conclusion
We were born once and will die once. Every one of us has one life. Only one life; there is no alternative. In order to make such a precious life truly precious, we have to live and die for the sake of God and mankind. Jesus showed us the right way to go, and we must follow his way (Matthew 8:24-36).","prayer": "Father in Jesus name, thank you for your everlasting word.

But they missed the whole point when they concentrated on determining what they were not allowed to do on a Sabbath day. They went on to define what constituted work in terms of the distance they could travel and the weight they could lift legitimately on the Sabbath. The Pharisees tried to extrapolate the restriction on work to ridiculous extents when they objected to Jesus healing sick people on the Sabbath (Mt.12:10). Even now in Israel there are those who believe that switching on lights on the Sabbath day can cause minute sparks in the switch which would be against the law forbidding lighting of fire on the Sabbath day! 

Are we Christians really any better? Don\'t we unconsciously major on \"what we are not allowed to do\" instead of thinking about how much closer we can get to God? Even churches sometimes make unwritten rules on what is acceptable, and it is not uncommon for people from different churches to compare notes on these when they meet each other. As children grow up they associate Christianity with what all that they are not allowed to do. We too have missed the point. 

Jesus asks us to seek God and His kingdom first, promising us that then all other things will fall in place (Mt.6:33 free paraphrase). We can begin to see all things in the proper perspective only when God occupies the focus of our lives. Is this not the same thing Jesus meant when He said that only when our eye is clear our whole body will be full of light?

A teenager learnt that the cross indeed spoke of how much God loves her. At one point in her life, she was contemplating suicide as the only way out of her loveless, messed-up life. She had intended to take some pills with a lethal dose of alcohol. She was all ready to die when she started clicking aimlessly on some MP3 songs on the Internet. And of all the songs that were on her screen, she picked a beautiful song written by one of our church musicians.

Sensing that an awesome God with His amazing love was reaching out toher, she abandonedher plan to kill herself.

She eventually came to know how much God loves her and how He has demonstrated His love for her through the cross.

Jesus was also tempted in all points and that did not make Him a sinner.","bible": "NIV","devotion": "Our mind is the battleground where temptations are fought through, and our thoughts are what are exchanged in the battle. The attack comes in the form of thoughts that are propelled by the desires in our flesh (Jas.1:14). These thoughts may come from our own mind as a result of associations with similar situations in the past. They may be ideas that are whispered into our minds by Satan or his evil spirits in the same way as he did with Jesus (Mt.4:3), or they may come from other people. When this attack comes, the temptation begins. 

At this point it is still only a temptation and not sin. Just because we have been tempted, we have not become defiled. Jesus was also tempted in all points and that did not make Him a sinner (He.4:15). It becomes sin only when we yield our heart to it, by doing what the temptation sugggests or by enjoying the sinful pleasures we get by letting imaginations run in the direction of the temptation (Jas.1:15). But if we stop the temptation right there, and refuse to yield to it, we become victors in the battle. 

Most temptations are simple in nature, enticing us to do something that we know to be wrong. To sin is to do it, and to overcome is to resist doing it. But there are also temptations that are not so straightforward, where we are not sure what we should do. In such cases we may need to spend a long time waiting on the Lord, seeking to know what He would have us to do. When Jesus prayed three times in Gethsemane asking the Father whether He really wanted Him to go to the cross or there was another way to achieve the Father\'s goal without having to go through the suffering, it was this kind of temptation. The agony of this temptation was so great that Jesus sweated drops of blood during the process. It is comforting for us to know that even though Jesus took so long to decide or prayed the same prayer three times it did not amount to sin. 

Another kind of temptation is where we know in our heart what is right and wrong, but we are too weak to reject the sinful suggestion straightaway. The attractions are so great that we waver in making a decision. We keep hoping that perhaps it would be all right if we give in, trying to justify ourselves or imagining that God may agree to it just this time. We know deep in our heart that it would be wrong to give in, but we are not spiritually strong enough to quit on the spot. Of course this is not the best way to deal with temptations, but this is a part of growing up. I suggest that God would consider it \'not sin\' as long as we are fighting against the temptation, and that it would become sin only if we give in. He knows that we are weak, and that we are struggling with the temptation. It is this struggle that marks the strength of temptation.","prayer": "Our ultimate goal is to overcome in temptation.

Have you got why?

Paul, in this day\'s reading, encourages the brethren (us) to practice something here that we can adopt as a culture. He says we speak to ourselves (or each other) in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs... But for the purpose of this devotion I will only focus on the part about \'psalms\'.

Psalms is one of the most divine books in the bible and, in that, it is what I believe to be the best teacher of the most intimate and profound relationship we can have with God. I am sure you can agree with me on that.

Besides many other things, there is no better model of a relationship with God we can simply look at and see the relevance of God in our lives as children of Him than the book of Psalms.

David stumbled, fell, negated, had struggles with his soul (heart and mind), had struggles of living a pure and righteous life, he was tested, tempted and saw just about all of the challenges we are faced with or we\'ve been through. He continually drew strength from the LORD and the more reason why \"speaking to yourselves in psalms...\" He established a model of a man that has entirely set out in his heart to seek the LORD and find him and have that special relationship with Him.

Finally, the reason why speak to ourselves in psalms is because of such a phenomenal journey David set out and committed even himself and all to discover His God... and when you just meditate on these scriptures of Psalms you\'ll find David so inspired to know God and His Power, and no wonder why he was \"a man after God\'s own heart\".","prayer": "Confession: \"As my quest and honest desire of knowing more of You [LORD], I speak to myself in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs.

Recently, there has been a lot of conflict concerning this matter. As a messenger of the Most High God, I have been instructed to sound the trumpet, and engage the enemy whose goal is to easily beset us from the plan of God in the body of Christ! I am not here to entice you with man\'s wisdom, but rather to call this nation to repentance, and the church as well!
For too long, there has been organizations that have tried to silence the ordinances of God, to pursue their own agendas, and for that, they are in extreme error, and will face Godly judgement, whereby even I, will be judged. Let no man stand in his own pride, and suffer a diabolical fall to bonds, but rather, let every man repent and reconcile each one himself to God. I pray that all will come in humbleness before the throne of grace, and come into light the saving knowledge of the truth.
The fivefold ministry has been one of the greatest keys to successful ministry in every church. For those churches who do not operate in those five, are damaged very severely, and the growth will not be where it should be! I have visited many churches who didn\'t allow these offices to operate because of two distinct reasons:
1) They didn\'t have a full understanding of each office.
2) Control issues within the church.
Whenever a church is operating within these fivefold offices, then church organizations no longer are in control. The Pastors are no longer in control. God is in control! I am going to explain each office, and what each office pertains to. There is no way that I can go into complete detail of what each does, for the sake of time and space, this will be a general overview of each office, so that you can understand better. My goal is to explain each office, so that those who are called into ministry (in which, we all are) may get to know what office they are clearly called into. This is vital for each one to know.
First, I want to break down the scripture above, so that you have a clear understanding of what Paul was writing in the Spirit to the Ephesian church:
Ephesians 4:11
All offices are separated by semi-colons. Why? because each office separated means that it is exclusive from the others- this is on purpose. Notice that Pastors and Teachers are together? Why? the omission of the Pastor and Teachers together, seems to indicate that Pastors and Teachers are included under one class. The two belong together. No man is fit to be a Pastor who cannot also teach, and the Teacher needs the knowledge which Pastoral experience gives.
Ephesians 4:12
\"For the perfecting of the saints...\" Hmm...so this means that the saints cannot reach perfection unless there is a fivefold ministry in the church? That\'s ludacris, right? No...
\"For the work of the ministry...\" Who is this talking about here? That\'s right! The saints! To perfect the saints so that they can work in the ministry that they\'ve been called in!
\"For the edifying (building) of the body of Christ;\" See, the body of Christ today, is not really the true body of Christ, why? Because the body of Christ consists of ministries as a whole, in one mind and in one accord! Today we have too many bench-warmers, too much competition with other ministers, and too much control by man (Pastors, organizations, monetary substance and even family members), and not enough God in the mix!
Ephesians 4:13
\"Till we all come to the untiy of the faith...\" Without the Fivefold ministry in the church, there are disagreements, discontent, backbiting, slander, maiiciousness, greed, envy, strife, fornication, adultery, and pride! When we all have a common job to do, we find ourselves reaching and preaching for that common goal. A God-given goal! It is to be all in one mind and in one accord...
\"and of the knowledge (full discernment) of the Son of God...\" This is only revealed by the Spirit of truth, therefore \"discernment\"...
\"Unto a perfect man..\" Why does it say here a perfect man? Because we are to be ONE! One perfect man (Christ). This is where it gets deep, so I\'ll save that for another blog. Let\'s put it this way: When God sees us (in Christ\'s stead), He sees us as one in him, not apart (or separate) from Him!
\"unto the measure of the stature (maturity) of the fulness of Christ (upon and in the earth);\" This goes back to that perfct man that I explained. So what are these callings, and what do they entail? Let\'s take a look, shall we?
Apostles
Apostles pioneer churches. They build them from the ground up. They establish them. They have special inspiration from God, and are given supreme authority over the churches (this is why denominations have ruled them out). True Apostles are accredited by signs and miracles following their ministry (self-proclaimed \"Apostles\" do not), Apostles have an unlimited commission to preach the Gospel and found churches. Apostles oversee and are responsible for every church that they have pioneered.
Prophets
Prophets are known as \"Spiritual Cowboys\". They are to drive the body in a certain direction. They do this by adhering to the voice of God, and then by protecting, warning, challenging, and directing the body of Christ to go a certain way! Prophets/Prophetesses are called by God, and God alone. Prophets expound under the immediate influence of the Holy Ghost, and thus extinguished from Teachers. Prophets are somewhat in a category all their own. They are peculiar, somewhat weird to church and society, and are oftentimes abandoned by man because of their being misunderstood by mainstream religious groups. True Prophets of God are dealt with by God and God alone. They are oftentimes trained in ministry alone, with some guidance by other true Prophets appointed over them, as in a \'school of Prophets\' as Elisha attended, but not every true Prophet of God is called in this way (As Elijah and Jeremiah). False \"Prophets\" are mainly \'soothsayers\", often known as a \'slithering tongued serpent\', tickling the ears to gain your trust. This world is full of them! True Prophets of God can operate as an Evangelist, Pastor or Teacher. Prophets are also followed by signs and miracles when directed by God to do so. They only speak the oracles of God, and are assisted by God to carry out the Prophet\'s assignment. Apostles and Prophets oftentimes walk together. They are both over the Evangelist, Pastor and Teacher.
Evangelist
The Evangelist has the job of the missionary. His job is to go out into the highways and biways and compel them to come in. They are used to \'gather\' new converts into the fold or flock (church body). Many Evangelists travel, and are to be constantly on the road, except for the time of \'refreshing\' or encouragement from other ministries within the body of Christ (not necessarily a \"home\" church). The Evangelist works hand-in-hand with the Pastor and Teacher, although the Pastor is over the Teacher.
Pastors & Teachers
Pastors and Teachers fall into the same category because they work hand-in-hand . One accents the other. Pastors and Teachers work directly with a certain \"church\" or body, to help them to discover their calling and start to move into that calling by training and yes, on-hands training. Pastors main job is to \"shepherd\" the flock, or \'oversee\', to make sure to keep out the \"snakes\" and \"wolves\" (that is; false teachers or decievers). Teachers teach foundational truths of the Word of God, building the foundation of our faith.
In conclusion; Organizations are not to be dictators. Organizations are not to be rulers. 
 
Neither are Pastors! It is the order of God! Once again, this is the order of God:
1) Apostles
2) Prophets
3) Evangelists
4) Pastors
5) Teachers
Organizations are formed by man, and not God! Organizations have become man-made empires that have been designed to suppress (control) people (I need to interject here by stating this: Some organizations didn\'t start this way, but over time, they became this way). Many try to dictate the move of God, as do many Pastors. Organizations are oftentimes formed to try and adhere to an Old Testament way of doing things. Trying to adhere to an Old Testament order of the Priesthood, not adhering to the truth that we are all made Kings and Priests by Christ to the order of Melchizedek as in Revelation 1:6.
As long as Apostles and Prophets are silenced, then this puts the Pastor the head of the church (and not Christ). This is why many churches put the Pastor upon a pedestal, as if he is revered as the same as the Pope or Priest is in the Catholic church. Many Pastors are treated respectfully as \"holy\" men of valor and faith, whether they are in the right or not! Sad but true. It has gotten to a place anymore that unless you\'re a Pastor, you\'re not taken seriously as a Preacher, and this is blatantly wrong in the eyes of Almighty God! We all have an important role, and this has got to be exposed for what it is! We have developed a thing called \"protestant faith\", which comes from the root word \"Protest\", meaning we protest Roman Catholicism, yet we adhere to their ways of \'church government\'.
When will we get back to the way God intended it to be? When will we lay aside our pride and realize that the least (humble) shall become the greater in the Kingdom of Heaven. This is not about who is over whom, but rather, that the kingdom of Heaven can be filled with men and women and children of all nations, regardless of race, age, or creed. The more, the merrier!
This is not about the \"power\" or position of the calling itself, because the \'higher\' the calling, the higher the price, the heavier the burden, and the more the sacrifice. That\'s just the way it is, trust me! It\'s about a true church. A church without spot or blemish. A church that doesn\'t experience defeat. A church full of POWER!!! A church that is truly called by His Name.

Why in the world would God ask Abraham to give up that gift? In my opinion, it is for the same reason He asked me to call off my wedding. God wants us to love Him more than we love His promises. The minute we get those out of order, He readjusts us.”
While we don’t fully know the mind of God in Abraham’s situation, Pike’s simple thought sheds light on a struggle I think all of us encounter at some time in our lives – the struggle to love God above everything else, even His blessings. God wants us to love Him because of who He is, not what He can give us. Yet, how often do we confuse our love of God’s promises with love of Him? How often do we see Him as the divine blessing machine, ready to dole out happiness on our terms? The popularity of \"prosperity theology\" reveals how easy it is for believers to twist love of God into the pursuit of earthly happiness.
To be honest, it’s not just greed that gets in the way of loving God. It’s also a limited understanding of who God is. I used to wonder how some Christians could sit for over an hour praying. Is God really that interesting? I’d wonder. This type of thinking reveals a fundamental flaw in how I perceived God, and I think that flaw is what keeps many from coming to Christ in the first place. It’s easy to see Him as limited like we are limited. It’s easy to forget that God is truly our all in all. As C.S. Lewis once said, “God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself, because it is not there. There is no such thing.”
Still, had I not gone through a similar situation, I might not have believed Pike’s sincerity when she says: \"I am thankful for His grace that saved me from ruining my life by pursuing my dream.\"
In a “reach for the stars, be anything you can be” culture, the idea that pursuing any dream could ruin my life seems foreign. The more I think about it, though, the more I see that living outside God’s will – even if it is for a “good reason” – is a recipe for failure.
Yet, when we give up our dreams for something greater - for Someone greater than ourselves - we begin to see we can trust God no matter what. We find solace in the incredible peace that comes with knowing that even if life here includes sorrow or dreams unfulfilled, there is a God that transcends not only all that’s missing in this life, but also all the good this life has to offer.","prayer": "Lord help to seek you for the right reasons,sometimes our method\'s are right but our motives are wrong,help us in this time and despensation to do the right thing.Amen","ts": 2012-07-03 07:18:58}, {"id": 188,"dt": "","pastor": 31,"theme": "Endure in the good fight,soldier of the Cross.","scripture": "2 Timothy 2:3","reading": "Join me in suffering like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.

But when I came to chapter nine, something new jumped out at me. I began to see the word \"rejection,\" although it was not in written form. Perhaps I saw what I was feeling that day—rejected.
I was reading at the part of the story where Saul, a murderer, had just been transformed into Paul, a disciple of Christ. Even though Paul was a changed person, many rejected him because of his past reputation and lifestyle. Not only that, but as Paul became fully devoted to serving Christ—sacrificing his education, his life, and remaining single so he could better serve the Lord—he was falsely accused, thrown into prison more than once and shipwrecked on several occasions. Doesn\'t that seem odd for a man called of God? Wouldn\'t God\'s favor protect him from such adversity?
I thought about an illness that had lingered with me for months. It was so severe I was all but bed-ridden week after week, unable to do life and ministry. I had felt rejected by God. It didn\'t make sense. I was serving Him in more ways than I could count. Then, without warning, strong winds came and ushered what felt like a storm into my life. Clouds hung overhead and before I knew it, I felt \"shipwrecked.\"
Perhaps, you\'ve been there, too. Maybe you\'ve been rejected by family, friends, and co-workers. Or you\'ve been falsely accused. Maybe you\'re imprisoned by finances, or being blown around by the consequences of someone else\'s sin?
It seems so unfair. You\'ve tried to live right. You walk in obedience the best you can. You take God at His Word and trust in His promises. Shouldn\'t faith like this call for smooth sailing, instead of stormy, shipwrecking seas?
If we follow Paul\'s journey, we find God working through the rejection, the trials, the prison time, and the shipwrecks. Paul shared the gospel with the Pharisees through his rejection and imprisonment. People saw God\'s power at work when Paul survived the storms, when the snake bite didn\'t kill him, and when the jail shook—opening doors and loosing chains.
Paul didn\'t let his circumstances wreck him with a sense of rejection. He didn\'t allow self-pity and doubt to overtake him. Instead, we see in Acts 16:22-31 that after being stripped, beaten, severely flogged, thrown in the inner cell of a prison and his feet in stocks, Paul prayed and sang hymns to God. And others around him were listening. The power of God came in such a way that the prison guard begged Paul to tell him, \"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?\" He replied, \"Believe in the Lord Jesus\" (vs. 30b-31, NIV).
God kept His promise to work all things together for the good of this man who loved Him and was called according to His purposes. As Paul depended on God and trusted His faithfulness in the midst of his adversity, many witnessed God\'s power and believed. And the same is true for us. God doesn\'t waste our pain, our rejection or our \"shipwrecks.\" He uses them to bring about His plan—to position us so that others can see His transforming power at work in our lives and believe in the living God.

If that\'s true, and it is, then our challenge is to rise from the wreckage, like Paul, so that our lives will give testimony that draws others to the Jesus. Today I will no longer sit on the sidelines of life full of self-pity. I choose to rise, pray and praise, so that God can position me to shine for His glory, and so that others will believe.","prayer": "Dear Lord, forgive me for wallowing in self-pity and rejection.

You have the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding. This peace surpasses all understanding because it is the kind of peace which is not an outcome of a certain happening. This is the peace of God. This peace surpasses all understanding because you can still experience it in any situation you may find yourself in. This is not the kind of peace which is based on your emotions. This is the kind of peace which is established in your Spirit. This kind of peace cannot be affected by life\'s circumstances. This kind of peace cannot be affected by tragedy. This kind of peace cannot be affected by rejection. This kind of peace cannot be affected by hatred. This is the peace of God. This peace allows you to sleep in a storm. Do you remember when the disciples were battling with a storm, and Jesus was sleeping in the boat? The question is: how did Jesus catch sleep in a boat which was confronted by heavy waves? Where did He get the sleep from? Here\'s the answer: the sleep He got, was a result of the peace in His Spirit. This peace flows from your Spirit to your mind and body. The bible says in Philippians 4:6, \"be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.\" One of the ways of growing into this peace, is to trust in the Lord. When you continue to believe that God is faithful to His Word and that He will fulfill His promises in your life, you grow into this peace. When you abide in prayer and function in patience, knowing that God knows about your situations, you grow into this peace.

Of course, this is a difficult mental shift because we\'re naturally self-absorbed; almost all advertising encourages us to think of ourselves. The only way we can make this mental switch is through a moment-by-moment dependence on God.

The Greek word used for the devil is \"diabolos\", which means \"accuser\", because he is constantly accusing Christians before God (Revelation 12:10). The word used to describe lesser devils (Satan\'s followers) is \"daimon\". These are demons (Satan\'s followers). These demons are fallen angels (Matthew 25:41). Satan is also called \"Beelzebub the prince of the devils\" and \"the prince of this world\" (Matthew 12:24; John 12:31 KJV). The devil is sometimes called Lucifer because the prophet Isaiah said, \"How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!\" (Isaiah 14:12 NKJV). Satan\'s existence can\'t be denied. He has been around since the earliest days, deceiving humankind and causing death, destruction, and mysery. Jesus repeatedly cast out demons who were causing all kinds of sickness and disease (Mark 1:23-27,32-34). Here is the Good News: Jesus Christ the Son of God has power over Satan and his demons.

Jesus told him to sell whatever he had and give to the poor and take up the cross and follow Him. At this, the young rich ruler became sad. The sadness was a result of his great love for money and power; he wanted eternal life but he was not ready to take the first step to receiving eternal life which is making Jesus the Lord of your life. Jesus did not mean that it is wrong to become rich, He wanted to be Lord in the young man\'s life, then the rest would then follow. The problem here is that, the young ruler was not prepared to make Jesus Lord, yet He wanted the eternal life which Jesus offers.

And one of the questions is: why is there such a HUGE difference between now (or the new covenant/testament) and the old testament; well, mostly in terms of practice and the way things were done or even happened? And my answer is that: because there old covenant was merely a shadow of things to come with and in the new covenant. The old is the \'Commandment-covenant\' and the new,  the \'Blood-covenant\'... One was demonstrated in the role of God - as the Father, the other, again, in the role of God - as the Son. Later there came a time for the Spirit [and He\'s role] -- as part and parcel of the new covenant\'s promises. The old covenant was a shadow of the realities and things to come and the new is the substance - the original form. Colossians 2:16

\"We are not like Moses. He kept covering his face with a veil. He didn\'t want the people of Israel to see the glory fading away.\" 2 Corinthians 3:13 (Exodus 34:33) GOD\'S WORD.

The Glory is perpetually eternal! That is why if you are going to be after \"the works\" of God, like the Israelites were, you\'re going to be permanently short-sighted ...

The Word of God is clear that we have been delivered from the kingdom of darkness and brought into the Kingdom of Light, but there is no place where the Bible says we have been delivered from persecutions and sufferings. These kind of sufferings are not the ones of being poor or being in need of money; these are the kind of sufferings where we are not received by the world. Jesus became very clear that when the world hates us, we should always keep in mind that it hated Him first. When the Apostle Paul wrote this scripture (Phil 1:29), he wasn\'t just writing it out of nowhere, he himself was experiencing the sufferings which come because of the Gospel of Christ. You can read about some of Paul\'s sufferings in 2 Corinthians 11:25. Paul edges us to consider these sufferings and persecutions as a privilege and to also count them as joy. For we know that even though we are attacked, we can never be defeated, in spite of what we go through we always remain victorious; for greater is He in us than the one in the world (1 John 4:4). Friends, persecutions for the Gospel\'s sake will always be there in this world; always expect them and always be prepared to stand for Christ. Sometimes those persecutions may come from your very own family members or your friends, but you must always stand for Christ. When we talk about persecutions we are not only talking about being beaten up, we are also talking about being rejected, being lied about, being bad-named and many other things. After all, remain standing in all situations and be thankful that you suffer for Christ\'s sake; for whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for the sake of Christ will find it (Matthew 16:25).","prayer": "Lord, today I carry my cross and follow you; strengthen me through all persecutions and sufferings which I will experience for the Gospel\'s sake.

The bible says, “Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching” ( 2 Timothy 4:2 NKJV). Tell them what God expects – motivate them through the Word. He expects His people to be involved and use the gifts He has given them. “As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God” (1 Peter 4:10 NASB). God promises His Word will not return to Him void (Isaiah 55:10-11). It is the responsibility of the fivefold ministry to equip and motivate our people “for the work of the ministry” (Ephesians 4:11-13). Let’s challenge them with the Word of God!
Be positive. When motivating your people always be as positive as you can. Negativism beats the people down. Jesus said, “Feed my sheep” (John 15:16 KJV) not beat my sheep. Challenge them in the most positive way you possibly can. This will build them up spiritually, mentally and emotionally for the task God has gifted and called them to.
Encourage your people. Always be encouraging both in your preaching and personal contact. Let them know you believe in them and know they “can do all things through Him who strengthens me” – them (Philippians 4:13 NASB). Encourage them to try different ministries and areas of involvement until they find what God has called them to. Challenge them that once they find their function in ministry it will bring them the greatest fulfillment in life they could ever imagine.
Train in small increments. Don’t overwhelm them. Give them small tasks in particular areas of involvement that won’t take long to complete. Long term commitments will often seem overwhelming and they will be afraid to commit or even try. Let me give a couple of brief examples. You can do this in similar ways in nearly any area of ministry.
1. Let them teach a class. If you wanted to test them out in teaching a class you might ask if they would mind helping out in a particular class for only two or three weeks. Only request they do a specific portion of the class and observe the primary teacher the remainder of the class time. If they seem to fit and feel comfortable you can expand it by asking them to do another week or two and ad another portion of the class to what they have been doing.
In doing it this way, you are not making a long term commitment either. If they appear to be a gifted teacher you can continue moving them forward. If it does not seem to be their area of expertise – you are both off the hook. You can test them out in a different area of ministry at another time.
2. Evangelism. Let’s say you were wanting to motivate your people toward door to door evangelism. (This can be true for any area of evangelism.) If you attempt to get them to go out with you every week, most people would be afraid to even try. If, however, you spend a few weeks promoting evangelism and end with challenging them to go out with you for only two Saturdays and for just one to two hours maximum, many could muster up enough courage to give it a try. You might find many of your people getting fired up for soul winning. You could then repeat this every six months or yearly.
Use incentives. Reward is basic to life. We work every week because we are promised a pay check. God also rewards our service for Him (1 Corinthians 3:9-15 and 2 Corinthians 5:10-11). Our people need encouraged that God will reward their service for Him. We are saved by grace but reward is earned.

Using more immediate incentives can help motivate our people to get involved and be productive. For instance, if you are trying to get your people to bring visitors to church, you might have some sort of contest. The contest should have some kind of reward or prizes for the person, couple or family who brings the most visitors in a limited time period. Many restaurants and other businesses will give out gift certificates for specials things if they know it will promote their business.
Use your imagination. There are all kinds of things you can do to offer incentives to your people that will encourage involvement. You might try an Internet search for additional ideas. Hopefully this has given you a beginning place and the Holy Spirit will guide you from here and stir your imagination.
Awards. It is always a good idea to have an award ceremony once or twice a year for the workers you have. This can be a wonderful source of encouragement for their service to the Lord and the local church. Bringing attention to those who are presently being used of God in the local church may also be an encouragement for those sitting on the sidelines to get involved.
Set attainable goals. As Pastors, we often have an overall vision for what we believe God wants for our ministry. This is great for “Where there is no vision, the people perish” (Proverbs 29:18 KJV). However, people need to see things in more short term increments. They need to be able to see the fruit of their labor. One of our greatest challenges is to break down our vision (goals) into smaller segments – something our people can see in the not so distant future. Do projects and short term goals that you know are attainable. In doing so your people will be encouraged, get excited and fired up. Before long, you’ll be hearing them proclaim “What’s the next challenge God has for us?”","prayer": "Father God, I know you desire for your people to be involved and productive.

But, what could this mean to us today as the Church (or the Ecclesia) and Body of Christ, as the Bible constantly informs us that we should imitate Christ and be more like Him? Think about it, meanwhile. Actually, the many sorrows Jesus had were not only because people had rejected and despised Him but this was also because wherever, as we conclude, Jesus went, He would see so much chaos and inconsistencies, and nonalignment with the WORD and ultimately feel so much weight on His shoulders as a result. Some of these examples could be that the world is perverse; there are worldly orders and systems to pull down and destroy; the are lies and there is falsehood to counter; and the people are not so much convinced by the Power of God to advance His Kingdom on earth and take domain on earth, as God had given them in the beginning.

This is what he said, \"Faith is a positive response to what God has already done\". Immediately I received a revelation that Faith actually cannot Create, it ONLY Receives. For many years, many of us have thought that faith comes up with new things which God had never done before. We have always thought that faith causes God to do something for the very first time. But hey, the truth is that faith depends entirely on what has been done, it cannot create. WOW. What a new perspective on Faith. Just before He died on the cross, Jesus said, \"It is finished\" (John 19:30). What did He mean by this? He meant that all the requirements needed for man to live the exact life of God have been met and fulfilled. Therefore, faith only picks up from what was done be grace. God does not need to start working on creating your success, instead you need to start receiving it by faith. God does not need to create your healing, you just need to receive it by faith. It\'s already done, just receive it by faith.","prayer": "Lord we thank you that you continue to reveal your Word to us. Thank you for this revelation on faith.

In fact God Himself is love. I have been meditating on this scripture (John 13:35) for the past few days. What amazes me about this scripture is that God says our practice and demonstration of love is what will tell people that we are His. He doesn\'t say that people will know that we are His when we preach a lot; or when we perform miracles; or when we cast out demons; or when we heal the sick; or when we drive expensive cars and live in big houses. No! Not at all. He says people will know that we are His when we love one another. Therefore, God defines himself by love. Love is God\'s only definition and representative. That\'s why the Bible says even if you can move mountains, if you don\'t have love, you are nothing (1 Cor 13:2). We should never think that the world believes that we belong to Christ simply because of the beautiful churches we go to; or the nice lives we live; that can never be enough to convince the world that we are of Christ. Love is the only answer to the world knowing that we are of Christ, because God\'s definition is Love.","prayer": "Lord, teach us how to walk in love.

Life is often spent doing mundane activities that seem to have little eternal purpose.

The great prophet Isaiah was struggling with his own purpose. He knew he was chosen to be a voice for God, yet life became purposeless for Isaiah. We all go through periods when our purpose seems to be clouded with the mundane. We see little meaning in life. On the other hand, Isaiah didn’t stay in this place. We read in this passage that he knew the truth of his existence. He could look past his present circumstance and know that his real reward and purpose would be revealed in eternity. He knew that God was just and fair, so he placed his faith on this truth.

When life appears to lack meaning and purpose, remember that if you devote your life to the purposes He has for you, the fruits of your labor will be manifested in due time. “The one who calls you is faithful and He will do it” (1 Thess. 5:24).

The apostle John, who spoke of not loving the world, defines his terms in 1 John 2:15-17 when he said, \"Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.\"
Several observations can be made from 1 John 2:15-17. The first observation: John defines what he means by the world in verse 16. John describes three specific categories of sin that must be avoided in the world. This sin is what John is referring to as the world. 
(1)	The lust of the flesh.
(2)	The lust of the eyes.
(3)	The pride of life. 
These three sins are similar to the temptations Adam and Eve faced in the Garden of Eden—succumbing to which is what destroyed their relationship with God, as well as destroyed all that was to be right and good in the world.
(1)	They were tempted by their physical needs and ate the fruit, choosing it above their relationship with God. This was the result of giving in to lust of the flesh.
    (2)They were tempted by desiring that which would harm them because it looked pleasurable. This was the lust of the eye.
   (3)They were tempted to be their own god. When the serpent said they would be like God if they ate the fruit, this was the pride of life (See Gen. 3).
These three sins, \"the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life,\" are depicted in Jesus\' own temptation in the wilderness in Matthew 4, as well. Here, Jesus was tempted to sin against God by pursuing worldly things rather than God. He was tempted by His physical needs, the lust of the flesh, when He was tempted to turn the stones into bread.
Next, Jesus was tempted to do something spectacular by throwing Himself off the temple and having His angels recue Him, the lust of the eyes.
Finally, Jesus was tempted to receive all the kingdoms of the world if He worshiped Satan; this is idol worship and the pride of life (See Matt. 4:1-11).
These three temptations that Jesus resisted in the wilderness mirror Adam and Eve\'s temptations and sin in Garden and reflects what John defines as loving the world, the sins of \"the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.\"
The next observation we can make from John in verse 17: \"the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever\" is that he was warning us against sins that lead to death and about pleasures in sin that are not eternal. He was saying these pleasures will not last and instead lead to death. John was contrasting clearly the differences between the temporary sins and pleasures in this life and the eternal pleasures to come. John\'s concern was for the believer to have an eternal perspective and not to place stock in temporary pleasures, which all are fleeting. The pleasures of this temporary world are not comparable with the pleasures and blessings to come in eternity with God. God has our best in mind. 
The final observation we can make from John is from the context of his whole letter. From the context, we find John concludes his letter with an appeal to his readers to \"keep yourselves from idols\" (1 John 5:21). John was saying that loving the world and the things in the world above God is idolatry. Simply put, John was speaking against idol worship. John goes on to say in 1 John 5:18-21:
\"We know that whoever is born of God does not sin; but he who has been born of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him. We know we are of God, and the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one. We know the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding, that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.\"
John is not the only biblical author who defined terms such as this. James also defined loving the world or friendship with the world as idol worship. In James 4:4-5, James speaks of pride and unfaithfulness to God as unfaithfulness and adultery, \"Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. Or do you think the Scripture says in vain, \'The Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously?\'\" James emphasizes that our God is a jealous God and desires our worship and well-being.
This world was created good. The world and all that is in it was created for our enjoyment and pleasure. However, sin has marred the world\'s goodness, and its charms have strived for our affections under the influence or sway of Satan. God desires us. God yearns for us jealously and desires to give us so much more than what the world can offer. As far as we see beauty and goodness through sin\'s shadows in this world, that goodness is pointing us to Someone better, the Author of life itself, God. God knows the pleasures and sin in this world can lead us away from Him and can harm us. God also knows this world is passing away, and He knows He is going to make all things new. God desires our best and wants our good pleasure in Him, in this lifetime and in the next.","prayer": "May we not be led astray by \"the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.\" Would we come to the Author of life and receive life eternal from Him?","ts": 2012-08-06 14:21:53}, {"id": 250,"dt": "","pastor": 31,"theme": "Living Waters for good soil.","scripture": "Isaiah 55:11","reading": "My Word, which comes from my mouth, is like the rain and snow.

But I wonder if we speak about other natures as well. The Bible says we are the royal-priesthood, for instance, that means kingly priests. And for me there are two natures already, just in this sentence. We can talk about the Divine Nature of God and I am sure all of us have something to say and some understanding of what is the Divine Nature of God. But I just wish to share a bit this morning about the Nature of the King. For an example, we could think of the Omnipotent when we talk about the Divine Nature but think about Sovereignty, when we talk about the Kingly Nature; we could think of something else when talking about priesthood. These are different natures we must function in. They are not mutually exclusive; I\'m not saying they are. The few words God says to them both Adam and Eve after putting them in the garden, He says “be fruitful and multiply and, have dominion and rule” Gen 1:28. Since I’m speaking about Kingship, I will just say one or maybe two things: A \'kingdom\' simply denotes there\'s a king right. And what does the king do? They rule right, don\'t they? So it is like that. When we say \"the Kingdom of God on earth\" we simply say we\'ll become rulers and rule with the King of kings (our King) on earth right; isn\'t? And the Bible or WORD of God feeds us into this thing that the Kingdom of God is established by righteousness and justice. Another thing, in closing, is that, a king needs the kingly endorsement and equipment to assume position in effect. Right, so you have endorsement because God has proclaimed you a king, but do you have the equipment?? Part of equipment for a King is a Scepter (to govern, by righteousness),  an Orb (which could an object symbolic of what a king defends and stands for in his ruling), a Crown, with special and most expensive stones (which is significant of not only the status of the king as king but the wealth of his kingdom as well), Anointing, well you know what that is for and etc. I could go on but I didn\'t want to get this far with revelation.

A person can be stuck in the traps of the mind set by the evil one,this is what we see in our daily lives...for instance with addicts.

Scripture says that when two or more are gathered in His name,He will be there...a new revelation from this is the two not only being two people,but the mind and the heart.

On our opening scripture, it is precisely indicated how, if we want to live in the obedience of God and give the WORD of God first preference or eminence  and priority in our lives, we have to bring THOUGHTS to captivity - arrest them, thoughts, to Jesus Christ and make them obedient to Christ. People of God are called into the superabundant life God gives through Christ; and needless to say, I\'m not talking about the physical or physical materials only. The LORD could heal you, He knew He could minister to you in so many ways and bless you physically and spiritually; but the greatest challenge was BREAK INTO YOUR MIND AND INFILTRATE YOU. This is the most challenging part so the LORD knew, this was the ultimate breakthrough and pulling down of strongholds. There is a mindset of heaven or, as I prefer to call it, the Kingdom mindset. The Bible informs us of how we are ought to constantly be transformed, by the renewing of minds; with the WORD of God. If you were an heir in a Kingdom but grew up not knowing or being aware of your inheritance and royal status, you would inadvertently suffer loss and fall into the same impoverished conditions of life just as a pauper - extremely poor person. You have commonly heard of how \"the mind is the battle ground\". Because this is where you spent most of your time and meddle with different ideals etc. and the enemy persistently challenges this gate...

Marital infidelity does not usually just happen suddenly.  Emotional attachments begin to form between those not married and a relationship builds that ends in sexual activity.   Guard against this.  Build guardrails and hedges around yourself.  Be accountable.  Do not allow yourself to be found alone with nor spend too much time with a person to whom you are not married or is not your spouse. These relationships, whether in person or on the Internet, whether socially or at work, or at school or in university, at church or in your living quarters, resulting in immoral behavior, never gain what you need.  Having sex does not win someone’s heart nor solve life’s problems.  Hearts are broken and problems increase and life becomes even more complicated and uncomfortable.

The question is: \"does God expect me to always be forgiving and to never be offended?\" According to 1John 5:1, we are born of God. The bible tells us again that God is Love. So, according to God\'s Word, even though we are offended sometimes, we should never be offended to a point where we cease to function in Love. We must never be offended to a point where unforgiveness dominates us. We are born of a loving Father, if we hold on to offence we become wrong.

The Lord wants you to know that when you are still, He is not. Being still according to God\'s Word means \'totally trusting Him\'. Now, when you are still you are totally trusting in God. Since your trust is in Him, you cause Him to act on your behalf. This is what the Lord said to the Israelites, \"The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace\" (Exodus 14:14). This simply means that when you lean on your own understanding and do things your own way, you cause God to step out of the way and sit back and watch you; whereas you are the one who is suppose to be sitting back and watching Him do it for you. God loves you in a way that He does not want you to show Him how much you love Him, instead He always wants to be the one showing you how much He loves you. God mentioned in His Word that He\'s a \'jealous\' God (Exodus 20:5). I used to wonder why God would say He\'s jealous until He gave me the revelation for this. When God says He\'s jealous, He means that He does not want anyone to try to take His place or play His part.

Isn\'t it amazing the patience and the ability to endure God has given to a woman. A woman is a kind of creature that can endure almost any kind of situation life can throw at her. Why is it that women are the ones who become pregnant and not men? Why should a woman be the one to carry a baby for 9 months in them and not a man? This is because of the inexplicable character God has given to a woman. A woman has the ability to value. A woman has the ability to treasure. A woman has the ability to cherish. These are some of the reasons why over 50% of the responsibility of bringing a life to earth has been laid upon a woman. Sometimes a woman is only recognized by the pain she goes through. This is the reason why the Bible does not give us the name of the woman with the issue of blood, but it only describes her by her painful situation. Yet in any painful situation, a woman still has the courage to touch the hem of His garment. A woman is reliable. This is the reason why a woman was trusted by God to carry the Saviour in her womb. A woman can stand through out tough times. This is the reason why women were present when Jesus was crucified (Luke 23:27; Mark 15:40). A woman can be trusted. This is one of the reasons why Jesus appeared first to a woman after He was resurrected (Mark 16:9). A woman is very responsible and will never neglect her responsibility. The evidence of a woman\'s responsibility is seen in Mark 16:1 which reads, \"Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, that they may come and anoint Him.\" These women knew that they had to anoint the body of Jesus and they would have never let down that particular responsibility.

From the opening scripture one may be aware that it speaks in two folds: Jesus gave them Power, which in the Greek Lexicon is Dunamis, the direct translation of Power (and particularly the Power that the Bible is talking about here), and then He gave them Authority, which is also found in the Greek Lexicon as Exousia (ex-oo-SEE-ah) meaning Authority (and particularly the Authority that the Bible talks about here). There are three things I would like to share with you today on this subject about ‘the magnificent Power of God in us’: 1. Dunamis (Power), 2. Exousia (Authority or Divine Authority) and, 3. \'Creative Ability\'. Maybe most of us are particularly familiar with the scripture in 1Corinthians 4:20 that says, \"For the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power\", right. That\'s right; it\'s in power. That\'s even how it stands out in the first place and supposedly can prove to every living creature and principalities that it\'s of the most high, right! While \'dunamis\' implies the ability to make power felt, \'exousia\' affirms that free movement is ensured to the ability. In other words, authority (exousia) affirms that we have the freedom to exercise the power (dunamis) or make the power (dunamis) felt. Let’s read again the book of Acts, Acts 1, the Bible says “And you shall receive Power when the Holy Ghost comes on you… And let’s pair it with Micah 3 it reads [on the third verse] “But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the LORD…” Do we all follow the logic here?? Thank God! But the third aspect that I find equally interesting is the part about the “creative ability”. This simply means the ability to function as God. I’ll explain: God used words, for instance, to create all things that are seen and not seen (invincible). So I have the same “creative ability” in my MOUTH to create, because I’m created and fashioned in His image and likeness. So all this power resides in me??!! That is ‘the magnificent power of God in us’ for you! I hope you are blessed. Now show-off the power!","prayer": "As I come more in the knowledge of the Power of God, Holy Spirit I understand that you are the energizer; the Power of God in me!

It is simple to know God! You know, it is just the other day I was watching another man of God on YouTube, whom I will not mention by name, saying \"it is scary to be used by God.

And when they talk about the anointing, all they know about is the anointing for \"breaking bondages\" and setting people free. That\'s about all they know! You say: what is the anointing? They say \"the Power of God to break the yoke\". But that\'s not all the anointing does. And because of the misunderstanding of what the anointing does, a lot of the devil\'s kids are doing \"BIG\" things and a lot of God\'s kids are doing \"little\" things. Are you still there? It\'s because of the misunderstanding of the anointing. The Bible tells us that Satan (the Lucifer) was the anointed cherub. He was called the anointed cherub that covereth. And that anointing was a different anointing that Satan (then Lucifer) had. That is the anointing that most of God\'s children don\'t understand; they don\'t know it. But that anointing has been made available to the Church, but we just haven\'t known it. When you understand \'that\' anointing with the few things I\'ll tell you about it tonight, you will see why anything you do can turn into success, by the application of that anointing. The Hebrew word for that anointing is the word \'mimshack\'. Word says that Satan was the anointed cherub; it uses \'mimshack\' for that anointing. The anointing that was given to Satan (then Lucifer), it was the \'mimshack\' anointing. That anointing, the meaning of the word \'mimshack\' means \'expansion\'; it means \'spreading\'. So Satan understood that anointing, that why when non-Christian musicians, when they release their album and dedicate it to Satan it spreads all around the world in a matter of days. Why? Because of the Mimshack Anointing! Now, Satan\'s anointing was NOT taken from him, he corrupted it; so it\'s a corrupted anointing. So it\'s working but not producing God\'s results; but it\'s working! It\'s called the anointing for \'expansion\'. And many of God\'s children don\'t understand it; so Satan\'s kids are still using it. That\'s why he (satan) delivers it to them (the non-Christians) in their businesses. They start-up a business and it spreads; it expands. The believer with anointing for \"breaking yokes\" starts-up a business and and then, there are no yokes to break, so, nothing works. Hahaha... You see why he speaks in tongues and he\'s still not making progress. Why? Because he has converted he\'s anointing for casting out devils only. No; you\'re to take charge and take advantage of the Mimshack Anointing - the anointing for expansion; the anointing for spreading... Some of you have good designs, you\'re good tailors but only your friends know. With the Mimshack Anointing it will go beyond the boarders… until that anointing carries the work all around the world… [until] you become number 1!! Look at Jesus, He functioned in that anointing: He had 12 men, before long He had a multitude of disciples. Now, look at it, ALL OVER THE WORLD – HE’S GOT PEOPLE CALLING “THE BLESSED NAME OF JESUS”. Look at His Church, He said “I will build my Church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” He says [in the city of Ephesus] so mightily grew the WORD of God and prevailed. The word PREVAILED. Why? The anointing for spreading. The anointing for expansion. You need to function in that anointing… It is not by might, it is not by power but my Spirit (or ‘Anointing’) says the LORD. Look at David, look at Goliath. It doesn’t matter how many giants of that industry are present in that business. You can come in like the young David with that Mimshack Anointing. It won’t take you long… you’ll become number 1!!

This is actually the truth anyway, Jesus was God in the flesh; just as Paul wrote, \"God was manifested in the flesh\" (1 Tim 3:16). The book of Revelation make it clear that Jesus and the eternal God are one and the same. God declared, \"I am the Alpha and the Omega.\" And Jesus also declared, \"I am the Alpha and the Omega...the Beginning and the End\" (Rev 1:8; 22:13). Furthermore, Jesus said that He, Jesus, would send the Holy Spirit \"from the Father\" (John 15:26). Here are three distinct entities, all of whom are God. The evidence is overwhelming for Christians: God the Father is God, and the Spirit of God is also God, and the Son of God is also God - yet there is only one God - so these three beings have to be differing aspects of a triune God.

There are two experiments, the well renown life coach and international speaker, Dr. Cindy Trimm, tends to make an example of. The first example is of a scientist who pours tap-water into two jars and afterwards speaks into them words separately. Into one jar the scientist speaks good and lovely  words like “I love you” etc. and to the other he speaks foul and negative words like “you’re bad” etc. When he\'s finished, he then puts the two jars in the freezer at the same time, simultaneously, and waits, after some time takes them out and, as expected, there is a difference between the two jars of water: the jar that had positive and lovely words spoken to has now formed wonderful crystals, and the other jar has now formed deformed and ugly crystals. In another example, the scientist takes rice and bottles it in two separate jars, like the first scenario, the scientist then speaks good to one jar and speaks evil to the other. And after a while, the outcomes are different, the rice that “heard” nice things in one jar comes out still relatively fresh and the other rice comes out spoilt. I hope you have learnt something. You see how important words are! Remember that 1) words are spiritual and, as thoughts in the heavenlies are like clanging bells, as you think, they are substance and form things.

They also say, if you\'re slow or not moving in life, automatically and by default you\'ll be eliminated from the system and therefore the race. But I am here to defy some certain beliefs about some things in life that could catapult us if we\'d gotten the revelation. We\'re challenging the norm! Now, back to scripture, the WORD of God says in the book of Genesis 7, God gave them (Noah and his household, and all of the animals that were paire, as God had instructed) seven days to enter into the ark before the flood came... Now, let\'s break it down: the Bible doesn\'t mention anywhere were He may have given some \'grace\' to the animal such as the tortoise and snail to move ahead and enter the ark days earlier than other animals such as the horse or cheetah. Now imagine that! There was clearly no competition there, though maybe these other \'faster\' animals may have bragged in front of tortoises and other \'slower\' animals, it says nowhere in scripture that the slower animals were closed out. Prophet Victor Boateng, of Zimbabwe, says, \"...Many are times you don\'t understand why God should give the horse seven days and give the tortoise seven days. But He that said seven days to the horse and said seven days to the tortoise knows how to bring the horse and the tortoise into the ark by the seventh day.\" I recently heard someone, in fact, Dr. Myles Munroe say, in one of his video-teaching messages on \'The Spirit of Leadership\', \"observe nature itself... Nature has a rhythm about it; it is slow yet powerful. And so is God - God is still.\" (that\'s just a paraphrase!) Some of you may be having the strength of a tortoise today and you wonder if you\'ll ever make it and walk in your high places - where the LORD is calling you. But even the tortoise told himself that \"He who said seven days knew how I would get to the ark. I don\'t care how slow I am, but I believe I\'m making progress. I don\'t care what you think of me, but I too can make it despite my trying circumstances. I know where I\'m going, God has told me; I will come in safely to that place! In conclusion, all that matters even unto God is your ending, and that terrifies the enemy. I am sure by now you\'re aware we\'re all winners and can make it and make it into \'the ark\'!

Midas wished for everything he touched to turn to gold thinking this would make him the richest man alive, not taking into consideration that \'literally\' EVERYTHING he touched would be turned to gold as well.
He got what he wished for and, unwittingly, touched his daughter and turned to gold as well. So that should somehow, immediately, be caution! When you pray that everything you \'touch\' multiply... know exactly the things you \'touch\' (or do) for multiplication.

When you do that:
1) Your loved ones are at risk. It\'s not just about you. When you wallow in guilt you tend to be more withdrawn and critical, and less open and affectionate. Everything around u suffer along with you.
2) Your health is at risk. Your mind affects your body. Doctors say bitterness generates chemicals that affect your vital organs. They increase your heart rate, raise your blood pressure, disrupt your digestion, tense your muscles, dump cholesterol into your bloodstream, and reduce your ability to think clearly. Each time you rehearse the past those bad feelings deliver more corrosive chemicals. Science is now confirming God\'s words that those who don\'t forgive themselves, and others, are more prone to heart attacks, depression, hypertension and other serious illnesses.
3) Your future is at risk. The Bible says, \'You will again have compassion on us... you will...hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea\' (Micah 7:19 NIV). Stop dredging up what God has buried. Start looking ahead; otherwise you\'ll get mired in a bog of your own making. The Bible says, \'He is so rich in kindness and grace that he purchased our freedom with the blood of his Son and forgave our sins. He has showered his kindness on us, along with all wisdom and understanding\' (Ephesians 1:7-8 NLT).

The Greek word for believe is “Pisteuo” (Post-yoo ‘o) and it means to have faith, to trust in. To believe, as in faith is far different than simply to believe in something. For instance, the devil believes God exist and fear him, but it does not save. The Bible uses the terms to “believe in” and to “believe on.” To believe on connotes TRUST. To believe in simply agrees that something is.

The greatest challenge to man receiving from God or being what God has ordained them to be is not the inability of God to do what he says, but rather the inability of man to believe in him and in his WORD.

In Philippians 4:13 Paul wrote “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”

There is a song (circular) that I use to hear which says “I believe I can fly, I believe I can touch the sky.” While this song might be a circular song, there is some biblical truth. Jesus said to Martha and Mary if you believe you will see the glory of the Lord. If you believe that you can do all things through Christ, you will. If you believe you can fly, you will. If you believe you can touch the sky, you will.

When you believe impossibility is not part of your vocabulary. When you believe you do not take NO for an answer. Today if you will reach and take hold of what the Lord has ordained for you, dare to BELIEVE. With God all things are POSSIBLE.

We all know how much heaven rejoices when one lost soul is redeemed. God delights in you when you share His burden and go after the lost souls. 3) To love not their lives unto death - Anyone in Christ should take up his cross and follow Him.

Look at what the stupid devil did the other day, he approaches Jesus (Whom all things were created through Him n belongs to Him) and he promises Him riches,kingdoms etc. Which belongs to Jesus. Just imagine, one day ur going back to ur place frm work or school n then u find a sales man there
saying:\"If u can jst kneel b4 me, i will give u access to this house its mine\". Anyway, Jesus was teaching us
through that event(Luke 4) dat As longs as it is not coming by the Name of God hv nothing to do with it. The riches,kingdoms were
offered bt in the name of the devil. Listen my brother n sister, the earth is the Lords n
everything in it and He gave it to man to have
dominion n rulership on it. And jst as he approached our Lord n Saviour, the devil is still approaching people n offering them what belongs to them bt in his name. Foolishly man give away their dominion to dat thief.
Find me a scripture where God gave the devil the earth. Many people are out to attain the world, all they are after is the world. i tell u da truth,the world was given to man by God
(blessing) once man run after it, it
becomes a curse. When man journey to acquire the world, they meet the devil n as he promised Jesus,he promises them n they accept what comes in the name of the devil. People are enriched through corruption, crime etc.(attaining in the
name of the devil), people buy things on credit(debt) and are 4eva pirating. How many care abt attaining things in the way of God? How many care enough to hold on to His decrees? Do it in
righteousness(in the way or Name of God) and all these things shall be added. Have
nothing to do with what comes in the name of the devil. If u take a good look at dat coin(or anything else) n

Decade of Destiny, where your life is focused and, as a result, you\'re able to make an

To get where you believe God wants you to go and be what you know God wants you to be, there are several steps you need to take that will get you focused -- First, determine your present position -- You\'ve got to know where you are before you can know where you are going.

To do that, ask yourself two questions: Where am I now? Where are you spiritually, financially, emotionally, relationally, physically, and occupationally? What would I like to change? In all of those areas you identified, what would you like to be different?

God promised Abraham that he would become the father of a great nation. But in Genesis 24, we find Abraham is now an old man and his son, Isaac, still doesn\'t have any children yet. Abraham assessed the situation and, as a result, he sent his servant, Eliezer, to find a wife for Isaac.

It keeps you in such a constant stew that you\'re not able to enjoy God\'s blessing. Don\'t let that happen to you. Instead choose to: 1) Forgive and forget. Unforgiveness just keeps you on the treadmill of resentment. Why\'s it so important to you to make others wrong and yourself right? If you\'re right but miserable, what good is it? Listen to Christ\'s words: \'If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you\' (Matthew 6:14 NKJV). Charles Spurgeon said, \'When you bury a mad dog don\'t leave his tail above the ground.\' So forgive, bury it and move on. 2) Deal with the roots of your anger. Sometimes the source of our anger is hidden from us; we are \'acting out\' the unresolved hurts within us. Exaggerated anger is often displaced anger. Instead of dealing with the person who hurt us, we vent our wrath on those closest to us. Ask God to show you where the real issue lies, then deal with it. 3) Take back your power. Mercy heals, but unforgiveness makes you a perpetual victim. Plus, while you\'re obsessing over the event and planning your payback, the other person is out enjoying life. God has promised you justice, so leave it in His hands. In fact, the only people you should consider getting even with are those who\'ve helped you.","prayer": "Father thank you for revealing urself through ur word.

For instance, Abraham told Eliezer exactly what kind of wife he wanted for Isaac. He told him to go back to the land of his relatives instead of picking Isaac\'s wife from among the Canaanite women. 

You will never reach a vague goal. The more general it is, the less power it has. But the more specific it is, the more power it has in your life. 

Ask yourself these four questions: 1) What do I want to be? 2) What do I want to do? 3) What do I want to have? 4) Why do I want it? You can\'t just know the what, you need to know the why - that\'s your motivation. If you don\'t know why, you will give up when it gets tough. When Eliezer heard Abraham\'s goal, he started asking \"What if?\" If you listen to the what-ifs of your goal, you will fail because of worry and fear.

Why does God make these promises? Because he wants you to learn to trust him. When you set a goal, don\'t focus on the problems, focus on the promises.

Find a promise in God\'s Word that will take you to your goal. This is what Abraham does when Eliezer, his servant, starts to worry about accomplishing the goal he is given.

In today\'s verse, Abraham tells Eliezer about the promise he received from God: \"He\'ll [God] send an angel before you so that you can find a wife there for my son\" (Genesis 24:7b NCV). You don\'t need an angel
because dozens of time in Scripture God has said, \"I\'ll be with you no matter where you go.\"

God is always with you whether you feel it or not. You just need to plug into the power.

In Romans 8:14, we read that all those who are being led by the Spirit of God, are sons (children) of God. And it is the Holy Spirit who calls in our hearts: \"Abba\", which means: Father! You are therefore no longer a slave; you are now a child of God. And because you are His child, God has also made you an heir (Galatians 4:6-7). It is of utmost importance that you as a child (son) of God, should never forget the core-truths of the gospel. 1: You must always remember that God is your Father and that you are His child and heir. 2: Always remember that God loved you so much that He gave His only Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross that you could be saved. 3: Always remember that the Holy Spirit came to live in you to reveal God\'s love and will to you and to assure you of your salvation. Always keep in mind these core-truths; meditate upon them and never allow yourself to lose or forget them! It is not correct to say that you are \"worth nothing\". It is indeed true that the Scripture time and again reminds us that man is like dust and like a flower of the field that wilts. But the transforming theme of the New Testament is that God loved us so much that He sent the Living Christ in this world to atone for our sins, to reconcile us with God, and to restore us to what God intended us to be. You are of such incredible worth to God that He invites you to call Him \"Father\". For that reason you should never speak or think of yourself as worthless. The Spirit leads you to rejoice in humble gratitude about the truth that Christ has redeemed you from sin and made you His child. In wonder before this glorious truth, you are called to forget your sinful past and claim God as your Father. To call yourself a child of God and yet go on digging up long forgiven sins, will only etch these sins deeper in your mind. It is a denial of God\'s love and mercy. By His Holy Spirit, God leads you to accept His forgiveness through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus and He helps you to lead a victorious life.

What do you do when you lean on something? You trusting it will hold you up. When you lean on God it means more than just \"I believe in God.\" It means, \"I am trusting Him to hold me up.\"

Who or what are you leaning on for strength? Are you leaning on the approval of other people? That is a very shaky foundation. People are going to let you down. Nobody can hold you up all the time because they\'re human beings.

You can\'t even trust in yourself. Have you discovered that you often let yourself down? You make promises to yourself all the time you don\'t keep. If you say, \"I\'ll just depend on me!\" you\'ll disappoint yourself. So what do you do?

\"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and don\'t lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him and He will make your paths straight.\" (Proverbs 3:5 NIV)

The bible is clear that He loved us even at that time when we lived in sin, and He made us alive together with Christ; He raised us up together with Christ, and He made us sit together with Christ in glory! What an honour! God has really honoured us! Did you know that you are sitting on the throne with Christ Jesus in glory? Yes you are! The bible is so clear in Ephesians 2:6, that God has made us sit together with Christ in the heavenly places. Sitting with Christ on the throne means that you are in a position of authority and power; It means that you are in the level of Christ! Sitting with Christ on the throne means that God has also crowned you with kingship; It means that you are a joint heir with Christ (according to Romans 8:17); It means that God (The Father) treats you exactly as He treats Christ! So, being on the throne with Christ means that you shouldn\'t say anything Christ would not say; You shouldn\'t do anything Christ would not do! You should now reckon yourself to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus (Romans 6:11). It was by God\'s grace that He made us sit with Christ on the throne. There was no way you could qualify for such honour; It could only be by God\'s grace. Therefore, since you have received that honour by grace, live by faith in relation to this honour. In other words, live like Christ. Live in the faith that you are already what God says you are. And if you function in such faith, then you must live out what this faith is based on. All that God has done for us by His grace, we live out by faith. Therefore, since you are on the same throne with Christ, live a life which reflects this honour which God has given you by His grace. Study the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John in order to get a clear understanding of the life of Christ when He was in a human body. In studying Christ\'s life on earth, you will realize that He walked in love, He always spoke God\'s Word, He was a solution to the problems of many, He was the answer to the prayers of many, He walked in power and authority, miracles followed Him wherever He went! This is the life you ought to live by faith. All things have been done for you by grace, just live it out by faith, because you are sitting on the throne with Christ. Blessings!","prayer": "Dear Father, I thank you that in the richness of your mercy and grace, you made me sit together with Christ on the throne.

When the Devil tempts you, what\'s the first thing to do?--Ask the Lord for a Scriptural answer! That\'s what Jesus did! When the Devil tempted Him and lied to Him, He just quoted the Scriptures! Of course, the Devil also tried quoting Scripture to Jesus, but he twisted them and took them out of context. So the Lord just fired Scriptures back at him the way they should have been applied, \"It is written!\" (Lk.4:1-13)--And the Devil fled! He can\'t resist the Word!

He is the father of us all.","bible": "NIV","devotion": "The story of Abraham amazes me no matter how many times I read it. It\'s not just the birth of a son when he was a hundred years old. That\'s a miracle. But just as amazing is the information that he waited twenty-five years for the fulfillment of the promise. He was seventy-five when God promised Him a son.

I wonder how many of us would believe God and live in expectation for twenty-five years. Most of us probably would have said, \"I didn\'t really hear from God.\" \"Oh, I guess maybe God didn\'t really mean that.\" Or \"I need to go somewhere else to get a fresh word from the Lord.\"

In our impatience, we often take matters into our own hands. I say we get \"bright ideas\"--plans of our own, which we hope God will bless. These plans open the door for confusion and chaos. Then their results must be dealt with, which often delays our miracle.

The Bible gives us promises, hope, and encouragement. God promises good to those of us who serve Him. Despite the adversity of our circumstances--and some people have absolutely terrible situations--God still promises good. Our sense of goodness, however, may not be the same as God\'s. Getting what we want immediately may not be best for us. Sometimes waiting is the best thing because it helps develop the character of God in us.

The Lord chooses to do good to us and to make us happy; the devil chooses to do wrong and to make us miserable. We can remain patient and keep believing God\'s promises, or we can allow the evil one\'s whisper to fill our ears and lead us astray.

Positive belief in God\'s promises yields good results because the Good One sends them to us. Refuse to give up, and you will see the results of your positive belief.","prayer": "Dear Father in heaven, forgive my lack of belief.

We must set our minds on the things of the Spirit and not live according to our fleshly desires. The more we walk in the Spirit, will be the more our flesh will be impacted by the Spirit. What does it really mean to walk in the Spirit? Walking in the Spirit means living a life which is completely based and established in the Word of God. There will be times when your flesh will give you a feeling which opposes God\'s Word, meaning that you will feel as if God\'s Word is of no effect in your life; when you feel this way, don\'t follow that feeling because it is a feeling of the flesh. If you follow that negative feeling, you will be walking in the flesh, and the bible says we cannot please God in the flesh. So it is not wrong to feel as if God is not working in your life, it only becomes wrong when you begin to follow that feeling.

Sometimes our faith can be tested right to the brink, to the edge, even to death to show that it\'s real faith! That\'s the faith you\'ve got to have if you\'re really going to make it. You\'ve got to be willing to trust the Lord, live or die, sink or swim!--Like JOB! Job finally made it, and it\'s one of the most glorious testimonies in the whole Bible of suffering and defeat and discouragement and yet a faith that carried him through.That\'s the greatest victory of all, when you seem to be defeated and you still trust the Lord.

So my question to you today is this: Are you praying about your goals? Are you praying about your future? Are you praying about your dreams or are you just kind of keeping them to yourself? 

Your prayers reveal a couple of things. First, they reveal how serious you are about your goals. If you don\'t pray about them, you really don\'t care about them that much. If you only pray about them once, they are not a desire, they are just a whim. The other thing your prayers reveal is how much you are depending on God to reach your goals.

So Peter got out of the boat and started walking on the water to Jesus.","bible": "NLT - Standard Version","devotion": "In the book of Matthew chapter 14, we read of an incident where Jesus made His disciples go ahead of Him to the other side of the lake. On their way to the other side of the lake, they were confronted by heavy waves as they were in the boat. There was a heavy wind blowing against them and it tossed the boat around. Between 3 & 6 o\'clock in the morning, Jesus came to them walking on the water. When they saw Him they were terrified thinking it was a ghost; and Jesus told them not to be afraid because it was Him. Peter then said, \"Lord, if it is really you, order me to come out on the water to you.\" Let\'s put our attention on Peter\'s faith! Now, I know that many people like focusing on the part where Peter started sinking; But today I want us to focus on the fact that he walked on the water. Let\'s look at 2 factors on how it became possible for Peter to start walking on the water. Number 1: Peter believed that he could do what Jesus could do. The bible says in 1 John 4:17, \"As He is, so are we in this world.\" Being exactly like Jesus means that we can do what He did; It means we posses His exact life! Possessing the life of Jesus means that you can walk in miracles just as Jesus walked in miracles. So Peter had the very same kind of mentality (faith), that if He can do it, then I should also be able to do it. Keep this in mind: It was not Jesus who presented the invitation to Peter, it was Peter who asked for the offer! Peter said, \"Lord if it is really you...\" This statement shows us that Peter just needed a place where he could place his faith. Immediately when Jesus said, \"It is I\", Peter then got a place where he could lay his faith. So, just like Peter, place your faith in Jesus and you will be able to do great things which no one can explain how they happened. Number 2: Immediately when Jesus said \"Come\", Peter got out of the boat! Let\'s put out attention on this line, \"Peter got out of the boat\". It\'s not only enough to believe, but you need to act upon the Word you believe. This is faith: acting on the Word of God! James 2:26 says \"As the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without actions is dead.\" Peter was able to walk on water because he acted on Jesus\' Word - \"Come!\" You need to take a step and come out of your boat. Pastor, what is my boat? Your boat is that comfort zone you are in. Take a step and begin a project even though you don\'t know how you will finish it! Take a step and do something beyond your human ability! That day, all the disciples could have known how it feels like to walk on water, but it was only Peter who got that experience. Why was it only Peter? Because he got out of the boat! Come out of the boat!!!","prayer": "In the Name of Jesus, I\'m coming out of the boat. I\'m walking on the water!

Later, it becomes very difficult for them to forget. Christ Jesus taught a great lesson of forgetting and forgiving. If you keep record of wrongs committed against you, you are inclined to miss the noble, good and beautiful things in life. If you cannot forgive, you begin to keep a record of wrong things done against you; if you keep a record of wrongs done against you, you gradually lose Christian love from your heart.

As a result we get discouraged and think, \'If I were a better Christian I wouldn\'t have such thoughts. I\'ve prayed, over and over. Why doesn\'t God just take it away?\' Temptation never goes away! Prayer doesn\'t remove it, prayer just drives you closer to God and He gives you power over it. \'Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you\' (James 4:7 NIV). The Bible says, \'The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand...he will show you a way out so...you can endure\' (1Corinthians 10:13 NLT). When you\'re tempted you never have to wonder what the right thing to do is. God makes His will clear in Scripture and He\'s given us His Spirit to convict, guide, and empower us. Plus, we can \'...approach the throne of grace with confidence...and find grace to help us in our time of need\' (Hebrews 4:16 NIV).\'It\'s a mistake not to take temptation seriously. Many who\'ve succumbed, thought they were strong enough to resist...When wickedness surrounds you, never assume you\'re immune...remove [yourself] from temptation\'s way...\"Put away the evil from among you\" (Deuteronomy 22:21 NKJV). Keep any form of temptation out of your home, your relationships and your mind by maintaining your love relationship with God and recognising you\'re powerless to resist in your own strength.

The only method which Jesus has given us for dealing with our haters is praying for them. Praying for your enemies is the only way which God permits for dealing with them. You see, God Himself is Love; And remember we are born of Him; This means that the very same Love which God operates in, should be the one we also operate in. According to God\'s way of doing things, He expects us to do what He does. God loved us before we could love Him, that is the reason why He expects us to love those who hate us or do bad to us.

In Geesis 24, Eliezer had a number of barrars to his goal of finding a wife for Isaac. He had to figure out how to get to a country he had never been to, then he had to find the right woman he\'d never met. And then he had to convince her to go back with him to a country she\'d never been to and marry a complete stranger. Oh, and he had to convince her parents to let her go!

I am not referring to your physical heart which pumps lifeblood into your veins. I am talking about that invisible heart we refer to when we describe the center of our feelings, values, and character. Do you think you have a good heart, a kind heart? I thought my heart was okay until I read this startling passage in Jeremiah 17:19, “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?” Another version says the heart is “beyond cure.” Wow, heavy words! Doesn’t that prick your pride? Desperately sick? Hey, I have my off moments but I can’t be that bad. 

But the more I read the Bible, the more I realize what the verse is saying. It is about the natural condition of our hearts. Take a look at little children. We don’t have to teach them to fight with their playmates, throw tantrums, break things, or grab toys from their little sister. But we have to teach them to behave, listen to daddy, give, forgive, be nice to other kids. Without discipline and instruction, we will have runaway brats and anarchy. It is in our nature to be selfish, proud, jealous, or angry. Look at the world. It is overrun by crime, lust, wars, corruption, and greed. It all begins in the human heart. Romans 3:23 says, “For all men have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” 

But God so loves us that He sent His one and only Son to be our Savior, our donor to give us a heart transplant. Jesus took our hard, sinful hearts on the Cross, endured our punishment and pain, and suffered cardiac arrest in our place. But He rose again to offer us a new life and heart--His own gentle, gracious heart, able to love God and others. 

God says in Ezekiel 36:26, “I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you your heart of flesh.”","prayer": "“Lord Jesus, forgive me.

He took ten of Abraham\'s camels with him, loaded with samples of the best of everything Abraham owned. He journeyed to Nahor and then made the camels kneel down outside the town beside a well. Eliezer then prayed, \"O Lord, God of my master, Abraham, this is my request. When a young woman comes to draw water, I will say to her, \"Please give me a little drink of water from your jug.\' If she says, \"Yes, have a drink, and I will draw water for your camels too,\' let her be the one you have selected to be the wife of my master\'s son.\" (Genesis 24:42-44 NLT) Now this was a big deal because camels can drink a lot of water. So that meant the woman would have to draw 20, 30, maybe 40 buckets of water. That\'s a serious commitment. And that\'s the kind of woman Eliezer was looking for - a woman who was kind, generous, had a servant\'s heart, was willing to help someone in need and would go the extra mile. And you know what? His plan worked. A woman named Rebekah offered Eliezer a drink of water and then she offered to water his camels also. Ask yourself two questions: 1) How do I intend to get there once I know what my goal is? 2) How long will it take?

We see his patience in choosing the right woman by maing a detailed plan. He didn\'t mae a snap judgment. He wasn\'t impulsive. The Bible says in Genesis 24:21 (NIV), \"Without saying a word, [he] watched her closely to learn whether or not the Lord had made his journey succeed.\" If you are really going to reach your goals in life, sometimes you have to delay gratification. You have to do the tough thing instead of the fun thing, the right thing instead of the pleasurable thing. Any goal that is worth achieving is going to have obstacles in the wa.

The head is the most important part of the human body. When applying for a visa or passport, you will be required to provide a passport picture of the head. Why? It is because they know that if they amputate a man’s leg, he can still live; if his two hands are amputated, he can still survive but once the head is cut off that is the end. Not only that, the only part of the human body that cannot be transplanted is the head! So when the Lord promises to make you the head, what it means is you will be the most important person around. What it simply means is you will become indispensible. It also means you will be at the top at all times. You will be so important that the strong and mighty will be coming to you for counseling. Jesus Christ is the head of the church, Ephesians 5:23. The tail on the other hand is so useless, the Lord did not even bother giving it to man. The head is the fellow in charge; the leader; the captain.

The head carries a lot of responsibilities. It is true that the head is the most important part of the body but do you also know that it is only the head that suffers headache? When everything is running smoothly, the whole body takes the glory but when things go bad the head is held accountable. Take for instance a football team. When the team wins matches and qualifies for major competitions, the whole team gets the praise but when they fail to qualify or win trophies, the manager (the head) gets the blame and loses his jobs. Anywhere you go to in the world, the head always gets blamed when things go wrong, be it in the church, family, at work, in the country. Even when the head is not aware of what is happening in the body, he gets the blame for anything that goes wrong. David and his men had just come back from war when they found out that the Amalekites had invaded and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire, 1 Samuel 30:1-8. The Amalekites took everyone in Ziklag as captives and went their way. When the men of David saw this, they became angry and began to contemplate stoning David their leader. David was in no way responsible for what the Amalekites had done; besides he lost his family just like everyone else but because he was the head they blamed him for the actions of the Amalekites. Whilst in Rephidim, the children of Israel thirsted but there was no water to drink so they began to blame their head- Moses, Exodus 17:1-7. When Moses could not find water they said he was doing it on purpose just to kill them and their children in the desert. It got a point they began to contemplate killing him. Moses too had no water to drink but because he was the leader, the children of Israel held him accountable for the lack of water. Thank God there is someone called the Burden-Bearer. When the men of David contemplated stoning him, David ran to God –the Burden Bearer. Also when things began to get out of hand, Moses too ran to God. No matter what challenges you may face at the top, there is a Burden- Bearer who you can call on and He will assist you.","prayer": "Father, please bear my burdens for me.","ts": 2013-02-23 17:32:29}, {"id": 455,"dt": "","pastor": 239,"theme": "I SHALL BE THE HEAD PT2","scripture": "Deuteronomy 28:13","reading": "And the Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them.","bible": "King James Version","devotion": "In Part 1of these series, we defined the meaning of the head. We also mentioned that the head carries a lot of responsibilities. The head bears heavy responsibilities because inside the head is an organ called the brain. The only part of the body that does not rest is the brain. While the hands are folded and the legs are crossed, the brain is busy at work. To be the head means I will be hard working. When you say I shall be head, what you are saying is whilst others are busy wasting time I will be busy working. Proverbs 12:24 says the hands of the diligent will rule but the lazy man will be put to forced labor. Been the head simply means I will make good use of my time. It means I will be the first to get to the organization, school or business and the last to leave. It means I will get to church before everyone. I shall be head also means while people are sleeping at night, I will be busy watching in prayers.

The brain is the seat of wisdom, knowledge and understanding. The brain is responsible for making decisions. To make wise ecisions, wisdom is required. Proverbs 4:7 says wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. Ecclesiastes 10:10 says but wisdom is profitable to direct. Ecclesiastes 7:19 says wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten rulers of the city. Been the head means i will make wise decisions because the head gets the blame for every wrong decision. One of the reasons why the head gets blamed for whatever goes wrong is because the head controls the body. It is the brain that tells the body to carry out actions. Where does the brain gets its wisdom from? Psalm 111:10 says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. If there is a fellow who does not fear the Lord, something is wrong with the fellow’s brain. To make wise decisions, one needs to have the fear of the Lord in his heart. Proverbs 8:13 says the fear of the Lord is to hate evil. Proverbs 10:27 says the fear of the Lord prolongs days. Proverbs 14:2 says he who walks in his uprightness fears the Lord, but he who is perverse in his ways despises Him. To be head means I will fear the Lord.

The end result of the story is that the man who had forgiven him heard of his deeds and called him back in and put him into prison as well. (Matthew 18:23-35)

The last verse says volumes about what God expects from us. \"So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if you from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses.\" - Verse 35

If you expect mercy from God, you must show mercy to others. People don\'t like to hear that there is a condition to forgiveness, but apparently this is the way that God works.

When Mordecai sends Esther word that the Jews are going to be annihilated, he essentially says, \"Don\'t think that you can just ignore this disturbing trend. Yeah, I know it\'s been tough, but this is your destiny. God put you here. It\'s no accident that you are a Jewish girl and now the queen of Persia.\" It\'s important to read on and see Esther\'s response to Mordecai in Esther 4:15, \"Go, gather all the Jews and fast for me. I and my maids will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law\" (NIV). Esther knows confronting the king is likely to mean certain death. She\'s going to have to use her gifts of beauty, brains, and personality to persuade him. But before she goes to see him, she sets aside three days to fast and pray before God.

If I had a privilege to rename the theme of this devotion, I would definitely rename it \"Christ Is All, and Is In All!\" The reason is quite simple and very clear. Our study text will be from the book of John:9-11 (the famous John 10!) In the reading of text, Jesus refers to two particular things in context: 1) The gate, and 2) the good shepherd. In this allegory, without overlooking other variables such as thieves and robbers (and killers), he [Jesus] first mentions the gate and in verse 9 he says what is very profound indeed, \"I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved (or kept safe). They will come in and go out, and find pasture.\" After verse 9, we read verse 10, which basically tells us about the devil - how comes only steal and kill and destroy, we can skip that and go straight to the following verse. In verse 11, Jesus now reveals himself as the good shepherd... So both of these things in context are referring to him.  I said, \"Christ Is All, and Is In All!\" He\'s the gate we go in through and even The One who leads us into it! Imagine this. Jesus is the gate and the good shepherd. Christ is all, and is in all. From the beginning to the end. Nothing exists without him. He holds all things together. He is the source of all existence. Everybody needs this saving truth that Jesus is the way that goes to the Father; he is the gate (or door) that entereth therein; and he is the good shepherd in whom is all the truth.

But when you understand your destiny and you know what God has called you to do, you\'re willing to go for it. You\'re willing to abandon everything. Knowing what God has called you to do and making the faith commitment to do it means setting goals. The best way I can put it is this: You can only manage what you measure. This is an important principle of life. If you don\'t have specific goals that can be measured, your goal will just be a pipe dream. You won\'t be any better, you won\'t be any better, you won\'t be any different than you are today. And above all else, make sure you set goals with faith. Why?

How many promises did God make concerning us? Many of them! All of the promises God has made in Christ are Yes and Amen. This means that the promises are true and they are fulfilled already. All we have to do is to walk into all the promises of God, because when we walk in those promises God is glorified. Walking in the promises of God means that our conduct, our attitude towards life, our actions and even the words we say must correspond with the fulfilled promises of God. A promise from God is not like a promise from a human being. When a human being makes a promise to you, the promise is under the chances of being cancelled or postponed; But this is totally different with God. When God makes a promise, the promise is fulfilled already. This means that when God makes a promise, it is now up to me whether I experience the fulfillment of the promise or not. God\'s promises are divine. In each and every day of your life, you have to make a choice of living and walking in the promises of God. Again I repeat, God\'s promises are divine; if you don\'t believe them you cannot experience their fulfillment. As you read your Bible and study God\'s Word, whatever promise you come across, know that it is done already; don\'t doubt God\'s promises; God\'s promises are not in the process of happening; they have happened already; All you gotta to do is to believe them and walk in them. One of God\'s promises is that He will never leave us nor forsake us. In every day of your life, live as someone who has the assurance that God is with Him everywhere He goes and in whatever He does. God\'s promises are Yes (meaning that they are true) and Amen (meaning that they are fulfilled already).","prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for all the promises that you have made to me; Thank you that all your promises to me are done and fulfilled.

According to the worldly system, you should only love those who love you and do good to you; But in the Kingdom of God it is totally different: You should love even those who don\'t love you or those who don\'t do good to you. The only method which Jesus has given us for dealing with our haters is praying for them. Praying for your enemies is the only way which God permits for dealing with them. You see, God Himself is Love; And remember we are born of Him; This means that the very same Love which God operates in, should be the one we also operate in. According to God\'s way of doing things, He expects us to do what He does. God loved us before we could love Him, that is the reason why He expects us to love those who hate us or do bad to us. Therefore, we ought not to take revenge, instead we should pray for all those who are against us; We should look at them with eyes of Love and wish them well in their lives!","prayer": "Dear Father, as I am born of you; Please guide me into walking and functioning in Love.

God announced this intention at Creation: \"Then God said, \"Let us make human beings in our image and likeness.\" (Genesis 1:26 NCV) In all of creation, only human beings are made in \"God\'s image\". This is a great privilege and gives us dignity. We don\'t know all this phrase covers, but we do know some of the aspects of it includes - we are spiritual beings - our spirits are immortal and will outlast our earthly bodies; we are intellectual - we can think, reason, and solve problems; we  are relational - we can give and receive real love; and we have a moral consciousness -we can discern right from wrong, which makes us accountable to God. But the image is incomplete and has been damaged and distorted by sin. So God sent Jesus on a mission to restore the full image that we have lost. What does the full \"image and likeness\" of God look like? It looks like Jesus Christ!

Your act of giving is an act of worship in the house of worship. Did you know that in the Bible, this is the only place that says you can prove there is a God? God says, \"Try tithing and see if I don\'t exist. We\'ll play a little game. You\'ll give to me and I\'ll give to you and we\'ll see who wins.\" I\'ve been playing this game with God for 35 years and every year I lose. When Kay and I got married, we decided we would tithe the first 10 percent of everything we made. We even decided that if we were in debt, God would still get paid before anyone else. And I will tell you, sometimes it was scary. Sometimes I was out of work and I didn\'t know where the money was going to come from, but God provided.

Let me illustrate it this way: When I turn on the water, I don\'t really think the water comes from the faucet. I know that the water really comes from a reservoir.

Today we might say, \"Know the state of your stocks.\" In other words, we need to know where our money is going. People say money talks, but actually it just walks away quietly. And you wonder where it went. Not knowing where your money is going to equal disaster. You get into debt because you\'re not keeping good records that show you what is happening with your finances. As the saying goes, you end up spending money you don\'t have on things you don\'t need to impress people you don\'t even like. And this causes all kinds of problems in your life. When you wonder where it all went, that is a warning sign. You are already in trouble if you don\'t know where your money is going because ignorance and easy credit equals trouble. You need to know what you owe, own and earn. If you want your next ten years to be a decade of destiny, then you have to keep good records because riches can disappear fast.

Would it surprise you to know that in Japan, the average savings is 25% of their income? The average European saves 18%. Yet, last year Americans spent 1% more than they made. Many people in retirement are going to be dirt poor because they didn\'t start saving early enough; they didn\'t practice the principle of investing in the future.

Now, there is a question you can ask yourself that will help you save more money. It\'s real simple. When you get ready to buy something ask yourself, \"Do I really need this?\" And then be honest enough to tell yourself.

For instance, do I really need a new car? Well, I know I\'d like it. But, do I really need a new car? Do I really need this upgrade? I know I\'d like it, but do I really need it?

A fundamental financial principle is this: when you spend your money, it\'s gone. Yet, when you save your money, your money works for you.

The Lord made coats of skin for them to cover their nakedness. Let us briefly focus on what type of clothes was made for them. The bible records that He made coats of skin or tunic for them. There are three things about these coats of skin or tunic. Firstly, it was not transparent; secondly, it was not tight or it did not reveal their body shape; thirdly and most importantly it covered their nakedness. The fashion world advises otherwise but the reason why God created clothe for man was to cover his nakedness. Bible scholars have actually pointed out that the coat was from their shoulder to their ankle. This is the first occasion in the bible we see God giving humans a dress code. As a child of God, whatever we wear must satisfy at least these three: 1- not transparent; 2- not tight fitting or expose body shape & 3- must cover our nakedness.

God is not only interested in covering our physical nakedness but our spiritual nakedness too. The danger of been spiritually naked is that it exposes one to attack. Ephesians 6:12 says we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. The question is what is our spiritual dress code? Ephesians 6:11 says put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. According to Ephesians 6:14, we should gird our waist with truth and put on a breastplate of righteousness. John 4:24 says God is a Spirit; and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. 2 Corinthians 6:4-7 says but in all things approving yourself as minister of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and left. Ephesians 6:15 says we should shod our feet in peace. James 3:16-18 says where envying and strife (opposite of peace), there is confusion and every evil work. Ephesians 6:16 says our shield should be of faith. The moment our faith weaver Satan wins. Ephesians 6:17 says our helmet should be a helmet of salvation and our weapon which is the sword – a sword of the spirit which is the word of God. The bible records in Matthew 8:16 that Jesus casted out the spirits with His words. To be fully clothed spiritually one need to put on the whole armour of God. Any fellow studying the word of God but not living in peace is spiritually naked because he is not putting on the whole armour of God. Putting on the helmet of salvation without the breastplate of righteousness is as good as naked. This is why we need to give our lives to Christ; live a life of righteousness; live in peace with everyone; study the bible regularly; build our faith by hearing by the word of God e.t.c. These are our spiritual dress codes.","prayer": "Father, greatly increase my faith.","ts": 2013-03-31 07:43:35}, {"id": 517,"dt": "","pastor": 226,"theme": "Don\'t give up too soon.","scripture": "2 Timothy 2:3","reading": "Endure suffering along with me,as a good soldier of christ Jesus.","bible": "New living translation","devotion": "In our life ,we need to learn how to endure tough situation.we have to learn to keep going in the face of opposition.The reason most people fail is that the give up too soon,they haven\'t learnt to stick with a situation or process until they win.Paul said:i hv been put in jail more often,been whipped times without number,and faced death again and again.five different times the jewa gv me their terrible thirty-nine lashes.three times i was beaten with rods.(please contin with the verse)(2corinthians11:23-25 TLB)oh my God lesson to what he said in Acts 20:25 NONE OF THESE THINGS MOVE ME,thank you Lord,his faith in god didn\'t waver,or did he give up.study the life of job,i learnt a lot in his life.he is a man of faith,patience,self-control and endurance.i don\'t know what you are going through today but i\'m incourage you to endure with hope.Be still and know that i am God says the God of love.have faith in him, he is in the midst of your storm","prayer": "Dear father,we thank for giving us hope in christ jesus.we know lord that our tomorrow will always be greater than our yesterday and today.Becauce of this dady, we have confidence to face anything that comes oue way.Thank you Dady, in Jesus\'a Name.Amen.He is our father,our Dady Amen","ts": 2013-03-31 18:15:45}, {"id": 518,"dt": "","pastor": 171,"theme": "The just shall live by faith.","scripture": "Romans 4:17","reading": "17 (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.","bible": "King James Version","devotion": "Romans 4:17

It is possible, if you are disciplined. Let me say, if you\'ve never been debt free, you have no idea the freedom you will experience when you no longer owe anybody anything.

And this is why it is important -- If God told you to go do something right now, some of you couldn\'t do it because you are in such financial bondage.

The Bible says we should not withhold the repayment of your debts, that we should let no debt remain outstanding. What does that mean? If you are only paying the minimum on your credit card, you are letting a debt remain outstanding. The Bible says don\'t do that. God is not going to bless that.

You need to set up repayment. You may be thinking that would be hard. It is hard! That\'s why most people are in debt. If it were easy, everybody would be rich. The fact is, most people do not have the character and the discipline to do what God tells them to do. First, give 10% to God; second, put 10% into savings; then, set up a repayment plan.

You say, \"Wait a minute. Are you telling me to save before I pay off my debts?\' That\'s exactly what I\'m telling you to do -- because if you wait until you get all your debts paid off to start saving or tithing, you will never do it.

And the problem many of us have today is that we don\'t know where our money is going because we don\'t have a budget.

But, if you want to get out of debt, you have to nip it in the budget. Do you remember Barney Fife, from Mayberry? He used to say, \"Nip it, nip it, nip it in the bud.\" We need to nip it in the budget.

Notice today\'s verse says, \"Plan carefully.\" That means budgeting; a budget is simply planned spending. Planning carefully means you say, \"This is what we\'re going to spend next year, next month,\" and by doing that, the Bible says, \"You will have plenty.\" It\'s a promise of God.

On the other hand, \"If you act too quickly you will never have enough.\" This refers to what advertisers and marketers and retailers call impulse buying. You know what impulse buying is? Have you ever gone into a store and you didn\'t plan to buy something, but you bought it on an impulse. You didn\'t think about the purchase; it was totally emotionally-based. You saw it, you wanted it, you bought it.

My body is God\'s property -- \"The body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord.\" (v13) Our culture teaches us that we can do whatever we want with our bodies. But God created our bodies, so we don\'t have a right to share them with anybody we want.

There was no way God could curse Adam because Adam was in the image of God, So He then put the ground (nature) under a curse (Genesis 3:17-19). Keep in mind that from the beginning, nature was under the control and authority of Adam; Adam had dominion over all nature! But after he fall, nature came under a curse. Up until now, nature groans with pain (Romans 8:22). Who can deliver nature from this curse? The Word of God is clear that it is the Sons of God! Who are the Sons of God?

This leads right into the second biblical factor for good health.

Confessing my sin is good for my health -- Any psychologist will tell you this - it\'s good to clear your conscience and get things off your chest. Your body is not made to hold it in. When you hold guilt inside you, it\'s like shaking up a soda can with the top on. It will blow eventually.

David says it this way in Psalm 32:3-5, \"When I refused to confess my sin, I was weak and miserable, and I groaned all day long. My strength evaporated like water in the summer heat. Finally I confessed all my sins to you and stopped trying to hide them. And you forgave me! All my guilt is gone\" (NLT).

David internalized his guilt and it physically affected his body. If you don\'t talk out your problems, your guilt, your bitterness with God, you\'re going to take it out on your body.

Doctors say a lot of people could leave the hospital today if they knew how to get rid of guilt or resentment over things they\'ve done to others and things others have done to them.

Spend a few moments in prayer today asking God to forgive you for the things you\'ve done to others. Then pray about any resentment and bitterness you are holding against people who have hurt you. Ask God to help you forgive those people (and you) so you can move on to better health.

The Bible says, \"A generous man will prosper; he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed.\" (Proverbs 11:25 NIV) Doesn\'t that verse just make you smile?

A lot of times people think, “I’ll have a good attitude as soon as I get over this health issue.” “Zedekiah, I’ll give God praise when I get through these tough times.” But that’s not how faith works. As long as we’re negative, discouraged and focused on our problems, it limits what God can do. You’ve got to give God praise first, and then the breakthrough will come. You’ve got to change your focus first, and then things will change in your favor. Praise always precedes the victory.

“What do you mean?”
“That He will resurrect just as He used to say?”
“Do you too believe in those mere words without any foundation?”
“I was just wondering because something unusual happened yesterday.”
‘What is that?”
“I was standing there at Calvary Hill when Jesus died, there was total darkness thereafter and this has never happened before, can you imagine it was at 3.00pm and then comes darkness?”

The earth trembled, it quaked, and the rocks split. There was something going on down there. The devil, Satan, was celebrating with his dark angels for killing Jesus.
They were happy that it was over now and they could torment mankind forever.
They gathered together, all of them around Satan himself. They were going to make cheers when certainly something happened. This sounded bad. Their party was interrupted by the noise they heard, someone was coming into their party, but this was one was uninvited.
Jesus, was the man, He came and thrust forward to the enemy. He snatched the Keys of the kingdom from Satan; all the other demons could not stand the Light and countenance that was on Jesus. They trembled and fell down, Jesus came out of the tomb. The stone that was laid there could not hinder Him. The third day had come and so He must come out. Behold He is risen!
The soldiers could not do anything at all, they were frightened when they earth shook, and they reported to the authorities what had happened. The authorities decided to cover up this and said that the disciples of Jesus had stolen Jesus’ body. This was a lie, Jesus is risen, He is sitteth at the right hand of God right now.
The enemy thought that this would remain to like that forever, but the truth is that Jesus is risen.
He appeared to Mary, she could not know Him. 
“Woman, why are you crying?
What, this voice sounded familiar to her.
“Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him and I will take Him away.”
“Mary.”
This is Jesus. He is risen. She recognizes Jesus as her teacher. She could not mistake that. She was absolutely sure that this was Jesus.
This was confirmed when Jesus told her to go ahead and let the others know that He was risen. 
“Simon, Simon, the Lord is risen!”
Peter hears this and with the other disciple they ran toward the tomb. The tomb is empty but the angels confirm this to them that He is surely risen from the death. He had conquered death. Death could not handle Him. The Pharisees thought they had finished Him. The Jews thought that it was now over, but oh, Jesus proved them wrong, He was the savoir of mankind and all prophecy had to be fulfilled!
“This man did great things. I wonder why they had to kill such a good man”
“HE healed my people whom I personally know”
“Yes even the blind man , you remember?”
“Yes, but people are so cruel, how could they do that to Him?”
“We thought that He could become King of Israel and fight for us.”
“Many thought that way, but now He is dead and we have no hope left”
A man appears and starts to converse with this two men on the way. He asks them, “What kind of conversation is this that you have with one another as you walk and are sad?
They don’t know that this is Jesus, the risen King.
He talks to them and expounds the scriptures to them
It gets late and they decided to take Him in. They prepare bread and as He breaks them bread and gives them, they realize it is Jesus!
He is risen. He is not in them tomb!
The devil can lie that He is not, but He is risen. They tried to cover this up that He never rose, but evidence is here, He is risen, the Christ, Jesus our Lord.
He is no longer in the tomb.
If Jesus rose from the dead, then all that had died in your life is coming back to life again! It is resurrection time!
All that you lost and thought dead, will come back to life.
May I put it to you that all is coming back to you. Your marriage, your job, your relationship, your family, and all that you desire to see is coming back to life.
The resurrection time has come and it is time to rejoice.
It is no time to cry but to rejoice since Jesus is alive!
He is risen, He is risen, He is alive!
Come see, the tomb is empty! Let’s celebrate. He lives forevermore! 
Jesus Christ is risen!

The truth is, your body was not designed for inactivity. God created you to be active. Even a daily walk will make a difference in your physical well-being and your spiritual well-being.

One thing I have noticed is that most of us are convinced but not committed. We know that exercise is good for us. We are convinced of that, but that doesn\'t mean we are committed to exercise.

What is the common excuse? \"I don\'t have the time.\'

Let me ask, do you have time to be sick? If you don\'t make time for exercise, you\'ll probably be forced to make time for an illness. Is that how you want to spend your time?

What is the common mistake? We overdo it at the start. We\'ve been looking at how physical health will help us reach our destiny during the next decade. Some of you might have already said, \"I\'m going to get in shape if it kills me!\"

We have the philosophy that if something is good, then more is better. We\'ve been out of shape for several years, but then we try to get in shape in one week! And so we work ourselves to death, get totally exhausted and, as a result, we wear out quickly and give up.

The key is training not straining. If you want to get in shape fast, exercise longer, not harder. And that will help you stay committed to a consistent, regular exercise program.

Why do we wait until our health plummets before we decide to create margin in our lives? The Bible teaches that your body needs downtime in order to heal and re-energize.

Listen to why this is so important: when you\'re overloaded by activity, you can only think of yourself. You\'re in survival mode, just trying to make it through another day. And that limits your usefulness in ministry!

When you have no downtime or margin in your life and God taps you on the shoulder, saying, \"I\'d like you to do this for me,\" your first response isn\'t joy. Your first response is, \"Oh, no! Another thing to do! Sorry, God -- I\'d like to do that, but I\'m just too busy.\"

We end up resenting the great opportunities God brings into our lives. But when we deliberately and specifically add downtime into our lives, we become available for God to use us as we head into this decade of destiny.

There are two things I want you to see in our verses today.

First, it says, \"Work hard and cheerfully at whatever you do as though you were working for the Lord rather than for people.\" (Colossians 3:23 NLT) It\'s easier to be enthusiastic about your job when you turn the focus of your work from \"I\'m doing this for my boss\" or \"I\'m doing this for a paycheck\" to \"I\'m doing this for the Lord,\" With that in mind you can do anything - scrape paint, wash dishes, repair a car - and turn it into worship.

Second, when you turn your work into worship, you start storing up credits in heaven. Colossians 3:24 says, \"Remember that the Lord will give you an inheritance as your reward, and the Master you are serving is Christ.\" (Colossians 3:24 NLT) As you work for God, you are making eternal deposits in heaven.

\"So whatever you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.\" (1 Corinthians 10:31 NIV) It doesn\'t matter if you\'re rearranging papers or signing bills, any job can become an act of worship if you do it enthusiastically for God.

Look again at today\'s verse because some people have a misunderstanding about temptation. They think that, once they become a Christian, they should be beyond temptation.

It\'s important to realize you will never outgrow temptation. In fact, the closer you are to God, the more you become an enemy of Satan, and the more he will try to tempt you. The good news is that God gives you greater strength to resist it.

When you are tempted at work - to be unkind, to get angry, to be prideful or greedy - remember that every temptation is not only an opportunity to do good but, it\'s also an opportunity to grow in character.

For example, when you encounter an annoying co-worker, the temptation may be for you to get upset with that person. But the Bible says to bless those who curse you and pray for those who offend you. So instead of getting mad, use it as an opportunity to praise God.

First, Satan will get annoyed that you\'re praising God. The more you praise God, the less Satan will use that as a temptation in your life.

Second, you\'ll find yourself naturally growing in godly character as you apply God\'s Word to your life.

Even when they are irritable, even when they don\'t like you, even when they make fun of you, even when they put you down for being a Christian, you must still be a friend to them.

Why is this so important for success? Because the number one lesson in life, the number one reason God put you on this earth, is to learn how to love. God is love and he wants you to be like him.

It\'s easy to love people you like, the people you find easy to get along with. So if God\'s going to teach you real love, realize that he\'s going to put you around unlovely people.

\"Everything you do must be done with love\" - This means at the office, in the car, on a sales trip, whatever. The good news is this really is not hard. It\'s easy to underestimate the power of a kind word, a friendly smile, a pat on the back, a genuine compliment, a word of encouragement, and a listening ear.

I have seen so many lives changed when somebody takes time to pay attention to them. There is not a person on this planet who isn\'t starving for attention. But a caring person is hard to find.

The Apostle Paul said this, \"I have no one else like Timothy, who genuinely cares about your welfare.\" (Philippians 2:20 NLT) Does that sound like your workplace?

And then He said in effect, “If they don’t receive the peace that you’re offering, then it will come back to you.” That tells me that if you will do your best to be at peace with people, even if they won’t take your peace, the good news is that peace will just come back to you. You’ll not only get your peace, but you’ll get their share as well! That’s double for your trouble! When you do the right thing no matter what is happening, God sees it and rewards it. Today, stay in peace, cease from strife, and take the high road. Sow good seeds into others and watch the harvest of blessing come to your own life in return.","prayer": "Father in heaven, I choose to hold my peace.

Anger toward human suffering is not only appropriate; it\'s the catalyst for change. Paul writes, \'...Be angry...but...don\'t stay angry...\' (Ephesians 4:26 TM). The Chinese have a saying: \'Anger is the wind that blows out the lamp of the mind.\' So:1) Before you react, take a walk. It burns off excess adrenaline and it\'s more effective than stewing. It also helps you to think more clearly and handle things in a way you won\'t regret. \'A quick-tempered man does foolish things...\' (Proverbs 14:17 NIV).2) Recognise the things you can\'t control. You can\'t control other people\'s attitudes and actions, or unforeseen events such as cancelled flights and traffic jams. \'What should I do?\' you ask. Count your blessings, particularly the fact that you have God, salvation, your health, your family, your job, and a car to get to it, etc.3) Be careful where you vent. It\'s one thing to be angry; it\'s another to \'sound off\' at the wrong time. \'A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards\' (Proverbs 29:11 KJV). It\'s okay to share your feelings with those you trust and who are not the targets of your anger. But be careful, your words can come back and bite you!4) Keep your distance from angry people. The Bible says, \'Don\'t hang out with angry people...\' (Proverbs 22:24 TM). Anger, like joy and gratitude, is contagious, so keep your distance.","prayer": "Father thank you for ur grace that is keeping us going everyday,help us not to be controlled by anger in Jesus name.Grant us ur wisdom and strength.

We view obedience as a forced, unwilling decision to do something we don\'t want to do because we\'re afraid of punishment.

But that\'s not the kind of obedience that\'s in God\'s Word. Obedience in the Bible means this: love + trust + action.

It starts with love, as Jesus said in John 14:15, \"If you love me, you will obey what I command.\" (NIV) Obedience comes from knowing that God loves you and you love him in return.

A lot of people think obedience is about fearing God, but God wants us to see obedience to him as a relationship of love. And out of love comes trust (and, of course, fearing God). If you trust what God is saying to you, and you believe that he loves you, then that will lead to action.

You need to have all three because action without love is just rote religion. And love without action is just mere talk. (Rick Warren\'s Daily Devotional.)","prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, I Pray for wisdom and understanding toward the obedience of Your Word and Spirit and Jesus Name -- that will lead me onto loving you (and your Word), trusting and acting as I should and as you command me.

And his commands are not burdensome.\"","bible": "NIV","devotion": "There is a refreshing immediacy to Joseph\'s relationship with God. When God said it, Joseph did it. If you believe God loves you, and you want to live a life of obedience in response to his love, then this is how you should respond: When God says it, then do it. I\'ve had the opportunity to meet a lot of great men and women of faith from around the world. They\'re all different from each other, but they all have one thing in common. When they sense God saying to do something, they don\'t hesitate. They step out and do it.

First John 5:3 says, \"This is love for God, to obey his commands. And his commands are not burdensome.\" (NIV) I was talking recently with Tom Holladay, my brother-in-law, about why, when God asks you to do something, it sometimes feels like a burden. What\'s wrong? We decided it\'s often because of procrastination. When we don\'t act right away, it becomes harder to do the longer we wait. But when we do what God says, freedom comes into our lives.

What is God calling you to do? Is it a phone call you need to make? An action you need to take? Whatever it is, write it down right now, tell God you\'re willing to do it, and ask him to give you the strength you need to make it happen. (Rick Warren\'s Daily Devotional)","prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, we\'ve heard the word for speaking to us today (through this devotion).

That means doing whatever God asks without reservation or hesitation. You don\'t procrastinate and say, \"I\'ll pray about it.\" You do it without delay. Every parent knows that delayed obedience is really disobedience.

God doesn\'t owe you an explanation or reason for everything he asks you to do. Understanding can wait, but obedience can\'t. Instant obedience will teach you more about God than a lifetime of Bible discussions. In fact, you will never understand some commands until you obey them first. Obedience unlocks understanding.

Often we try to offer God partial obedience. We want to pick and choose the commands we obey. \"I\'ll attend church but I won\'t tithe.\' \"I\'ll read my Bible but won\'t forgive the person who hurt me.\'

Wholehearted obedience is done joyfully, with enthusiasm. The Bible says, \"Obey him gladly.\" (Psalm 100:2 LB)

This is the attitude of David: \"Just tell me what to do and I will do it, Lord. As long as I live I\'ll wholeheartedly obey.\" (Psalm 119:33 LB)

James, speaking to Christians, said, \"We please God by what we do and not only by what we believe.\" (James 2:24 CEV)

God\'s Word is clear that you can\'t earn your salvation. It comes only by grace, not your effort. But as a child of God you can bring pleasure to your heavenly Father through obedience. Any act of obedience is also an act of worship.

Why is obedience so pleasing to God? Because it proves you really love him. Jesus said, \"If you love me, you will obey my commandments.\" (John 14:15 TEV) (Rick Warren\'s Daily Devotional)","prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, today we come before you with a refreshing understanding of obedience to both You and Your Word.

But love all started with God. He loved us first and that gives us the ability to love others. (1 John 4:19) The only reason you can love God or love anybody else is because God first loved you. And he showed that love by sending Jesus Christ to earth to die for you. He showed that love by creating you. He showed that love by everything you have in life; it\'s all a gift of God\'s love.

In order to love others and to become great lovers, we first need to understand and feel how much God loves us. We don\'t want to just talk about love, read about love, or discuss about love; our need is to experience the love of God.

We need to reach a day when we finally, fully understand how God loves us completely and unconditionally. We need to become secure in the truth that we cannot make God stop loving us.

Once we\'re secure inside God\'s unconditional love, we\'ll start cutting people a lot of slack. We won\'t be as angry as we\'ve been. We\'ll be more patient. We\'ll be more forgiving. We\'ll be more merciful. We\'ll give others grace.

In fact, even the language we use implies the uncontrollability of love. We say, \"I fell in love,\" as if love is some kind of a ditch. It\'s like I\'m walking along one day and bam! - I fell in love. I couldn\'t help myself.

But I have to tell you the truth - that\'s not love. Love doesn\'t just happen to you. Love is a choice and it represents a commitment.

There\'s no doubt about it, attraction is uncontrollable and arousal is uncontrollable. But attraction and arousal are not love. They can lead to love, but they are not love. Love is a choice.

You must choose to love God; he won\'t force you to love him (Deuteronomy 30:20). You can thumb your nose at God and go a totally different way. You can destroy your life if you choose to do that. God still won\'t force you to love him. Because he knows love can\'t be forced.

And this same principle is true about your relationships: you can choose to love others, but God won\'t force you to love anyone.

Let\'s see how you act toward that person.

Love is more than attraction and more than arousal. It\'s also more than sentimentality, like so many of today\'s songs suggest. By this standard, is love dead when the emotion is gone? No, not at all. Because love is an action; love is a behavior.

Over and over again, in the Bible, God commands us to love each other. And you can\'t command an emotion. If I told you \"Be sad!\" right now, you couldn\'t be sad on cue. Just like an actor, you can fake it, but you\'re not wired for your emotions to change on command.

If love were just an emotion, then God couldn\'t command it. But love is something you do. It can produce emotion, but love is an action.

The Bible says, \"Let us stop just saying we love each other; let us really show it by our actions.\" (1 John 3:18 NLT) We can talk a good act: \"I love people.\" But do we really love them? Our love is revealed in how we act toward them. (Rick Warren\'s Daily Devotional)","prayer": "Heavenly Father, love is not an emotion; otherwise where would we be with you?

In other words, it\'s something you can get good at and that means you get better at love by practicing love.

You may think you\'re a good lover, but God wants you to become a great lover, a skilled lover, a master lover. Yet, most people never learn how to love.

You can become an expert at relationships. Wouldn\'t you like to become known as a person of extraordinary love? When people speak of you they might say: \"He doesn\'t care who you are or what you look like.\" \"She doesn\'t care where you\'ve been or what you\'ve done or where you\'re from.\"

The only way you get skilled at something is to practice. You do it over and over. The first time you do it, it feels awkward, but the more you do it, the better you become.

The same is true with love. (1 John 4:7) Let\'s practice loving each other. As the Bible says, \"Practice these things; be committed to them, so that your progress may be evident to all.\" (1 Timothy 4:15 HCSB) (Rick Warren\'s Daily Devotional)","prayer": "Heavenly Father, if love be a skill, as a community of believers in Holiness Page we want to master it with flying colors, in Jesus Name! a big AMEN","ts": 2013-04-24 01:24:38}, {"id": 589,"dt": "","pastor": 38,"theme": "Love Is a Habit","scripture": "1 John 4:16","reading": "\"And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us.

Jesus said, \"If you only love those who love you what credit is that to you?\" (Luke 6:32 NIV)

His point is this: all of us can love those who love us back. Becoming a master lover means you learn to love the unlovable. It\'s when you love people who don\'t love you, when you love people who irritate you, when you love people who stab you in the back or gossip about you.

This may seem like an impossible task and it is - that\'s why we need God\'s love in us, so we can then love others: \"We know and rely on the love God has for us.\" (1 John 4:16 NIV)

When you realize how much God loves you - with an extravagant, irresistible, unconditional love - then his love will change your entire focus on life. If we don\'t receive God\'s love for us, we\'ll have a hard time loving other people. I\'m talking about loving the unlovely, loving the difficult, loving the irritable, loving people who are different or demanding.

You can\'t do that until you have God\'s love coming through you. You need to know God\'s love so it can overflow out of your life into others.

One of the ways people feel heavy and overwhelmed in this life is by carrying unnecessary burdens or taking on responsibility that God never required. When we get out of step with God, when we go against His Word, things become more difficult. Condemnation and guilt can creep in and cause us to try to “work harder” the next time.

David\'s collection of wives, though it was \'legal\' and was not considered adultery in the culture of the day, was a sin. David\'s sensual indulgence desensitized him to God\'s holy call in his life.

1 Samuel shows us it is quite possible to do the right thing but with the wrong attitude.

When you come to meet with God in a quiet time, you should have these proper attitudes:

Expectancy - Come before God with anticipation and eagerness. Expect to have a good time of fellowship with him and receive a blessing from your time together: \"O God, you are my God, earnestly I seek you.\" (Psalm 63:1)

Reverence - Don\'t rush into God\'s presence, but prepare your heart by being still before him and letting the quietness clear away the thoughts of the world: \"The Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth be silent before him.\" (Habakkuk 2:20)

Alertness - Get wide-awake first. Remember that you are meeting with the Creator, the Maker of heaven and earth, the Redeemer of men. Be thoroughly rested and alert. Get to bed early so you will be in good shape to meet God in the morning.

Willingness to obey - Don\'t come to your quiet time to choose what you will do or not do, but come with the purpose of doing anything and everything that God wants you to do. Jesus said, \"If anyone chooses to do God\'s will he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.\" (John 7:17) Come to meet the Lord having already chosen to do his will no matter what. (Rick Wareen\'s Daily Devotional)","prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, You are the LORD God the Most High and our heavenly Father: We come to you today, not with the already cooked precepts and understanding, thinking to ourselves that we know God that much. But we come with an humbled spirit and a heart that thirsts for you. Remind us the proper conducts of approaching and being with You (in Your Presence) in Jesus Name.

The general rule is this: The best time is when you are at your best! Give God the best part of your day, when you are the freshest and most alert. Don\'t try to serve God with your leftover time. Remember, too, that your best time may be different from someone else\'s.

For most of us, however, early in the morning seems to be the best time. It was Jesus\' own practice to rise early to pray and meet with the Father.

In the Bible many godly men and women rose early to meet with God. Some of these were: Abraham, Moses, Job, Hannah, Jacob, and David.

Whatever time you set, be consistent in it. Schedule it on your calendar; make an appointment with God as you would with anyone else. Make a date with Jesus!

Then look forward to it and don\'t stand him up. A stood-up date is not a pleasant experience for us, and Jesus does not like to be stood up either. So make a date with him and keep it at all costs.

If you\'ve never had a consistent quiet time before, you may want to start with seven minutes and let it grow naturally. You should aim to eventually spend at least 15 minutes a day with the Lord. (Rick Warren\'s Daily Devotional)","prayer": "CONFESSION: I am aware that there\'s power in making consistent meeting times with God called \'quiet times\'.

The location where you have your quiet time is also important. The Bible indicates that Abraham had a regular place where he met with God. Today\'s verse tells us that Jesus had a custom of praying in the garden of Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives.

Your place ought to be a secluded place. This is a place where you can be alone, where it\'s quiet, and where you will not be disturbed or interrupted. In today\'s noisy world, this may take some ingenuity, but it is necessary. It ought to be a place - where you can pray aloud without disturbing others; where you have good lighting for reading; where you are comfortable.

Your place ought to be a special place. Wherever you decide to meet with the Lord, make it a special place for you and him. As the days go by, that place will come to mean a lot to you because of the wonderful times you have there with Jesus Christ.

Your place ought to be a sacred place. This is where you meet with the living God. Where you meet the Lord can be just as holy as the place where Abraham met God. You don\'t have to be in a church building. I know people have had their quiet times in their cars parked in a quiet place, in an empty closet at home, in their backyards, and even in a baseball dugout. Each of these places has become sacred to them. (Rick Warren\'s Daily Devotional)","prayer": "CONFESSION: I decree and declare, MY PLACE OF MEETING WITH GOD IS MOST SACRED AND SPECIAL TO ME AND GOD.

Wait on God (Relax) -- Be still for a minute; don\'t come running into God\'s presence and start talking immediately. Follow God\'s admonition: \"Be still and know that I am God.\" (Psalm 46:10) Be quiet for a short while to put yourself into a reverent mood.

Pray briefly (Request) -- Ask God to cleanse your heart and guide you into the time together. You need to be in tune with the Author before you can understand his Book!

Read Scripture (Read) -- This is where your conversation with God begins. He speaks to you through his Word, and you speak with him in prayer. When you read your Bible, try to do it -

Slowly -- Don\'t be in a hurry and don\'t try to read too large an amount.

Repeatedly -- Read a passage over and over until you start to picture it in your mind.

Without stopping -- Don\'t stop in the middle of a sentence to go off and do a doctrinal study. Just read that section for the pure joy of it, allowing God to speak to you. Remember that your goal here is not to gain information, but to feed on the Word and get to know Christ better.

Aloud but quietly -- Reading it aloud will improve your concentration. It will also help you understand what you are reading better because you will be both seeing and hearing what you are reading.

Systematically -- Read through a book at a time in an orderly method. You\'ll understand the Bible better if you read it as it was written - a book or letter at a time.

He wants to do things in your life that you’ve never seen before. He wants to impact you in such a way that you can’t help but talk about Him!
The key starts with us. Our faith in God is what opens the door for Him to move and sets the blessing in motion. God has given every person a measure of faith. He has given us all the ability to believe and receive from Him. Romans 10:17 says that faith comes by hearing the Word of God.

It won’t be long before you just can’t help speaking about His goodness everywhere you go!","prayer": "Heavenly Father, thank You for Your goodness and faithfulness in my life.

Even in the perfect, sinless environment of Eden, God said, \"It is not good for man to be alone.\" (Genesis 2:18 NIV)

We are created for community, fashioned for fellowship, and formed for a family, and none of us can fulfill God\'s purposes by ourselves. The Bible knows nothing of solitary saints or spiritual hermits.

While your relationship to Christ is personal, God never intends it to be private. In God\'s family you are connected to every other believer. The Bible says, \"In Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.\" (Romans 12:5 NIV)

Following Christ includes belonging, not just believing. C. S. Lewis noted that the word \"membership\' is of Christian origin, but the world has emptied it of its original meaning. Stores offer discounts to \"members,\' and advertisers use \"member names\' to create mailing lists. In churches, membership is often reduced to simply adding your name to a roll, with no requirements or expectations.

To Paul, being a \"member\' of the church meant being a vital organ of a living body, an indispensable, interconnected part of the Body of Christ. We need to recover and practice the biblical meaning of membership. The church is a body, not a building; an organism, not an organization. (Romans 12:4-5)

There is nothing else on earth like the church! (Rick Warren\'s Daily Devotional)","prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, we learn how the church is not necessarily a building with walls but a body; and we learn how the church is not necessarily an organisation but an organism that is living. Therefore we pray this morning for the real and true meaning of the church to spread widely across every church and member of Christ in Jesus Name.

For the organs of your body to fulfill their purpose, they must be connected to your body. The same is true for you as a part of Christ\'s Body. You were created for a specific role, but you will miss out on this if you\'re not attached to a living, local church. You discover your role in life through your relationships with others.

The Bible tells us, \"Each part gets its meaning from the body as a whole, not the other way around. The body we\'re talking about is Christ\'s body of chosen people. Each of us finds our meaning and function as a part of his body. But as a chopped-off finger or cut-off toe we wouldn\'t amount to much, would we?\" (Romans 12:4-5 MSG)

If an organ is somehow severed from its body, it will shrivel and die. It cannot exist on its own, and neither can you. Disconnected and cut off from the lifeblood of a local body, your spiritual life will wither and eventually cease to exist. (Ephesians 4:16)

This is why the first symptom of spiritual decline is usually inconsistent attendance at worship services and other gatherings of believers. Whenever we become careless about fellowship, everything else begins to slide, too.

Membership in the family of God is neither inconsequential nor something to be casually ignored. The church is God\'s agenda for the world. Jesus said, \"I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it.\" (Matthew 16:18 NLT)","prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, we pray for the prevailing of Your agenda concerning the church on Earth and upon every creation of Your Word in Jesus Name.

Today\'s culture of independent individualism has created many spiritual orphans - \"bunny believers\" who hop around from one church to another without any identity, accountability, or commitment. Many believe it is possible to be a \"good Christian\" without joining (or even attending) a local church, but God would strongly disagree.

The church is so significant that Jesus died on the cross for it. \"Christ loved the church and gave his life for it.\" (Ephesians 5:25 GW)

Except for a few important exceptions referring to all believers throughout history, almost every time the word church is used in the Bible it refers to a local, visible congregation. The New Testament assumes membership in a local congregation.

Only in regular contact with ordinary, imperfect believers can we learn real fellowship and experience the New Testament truth of being connected and dependent on each other.

Biblical fellowship is being as committed to each other as we are to Jesus Christ. God expects us to give our lives for each other. Many Christians who know John 3:16 are unaware of 1 John 3:16: \"Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.\" (NIV)

Your local fellowship is the place God designed for you to discover, develop, and use your gifts. You may also have a wider ministry, but that is in addition to your service in a local body. Jesus has not promised to build your ministry; he has promised to build his church.

You will share in Christ\'s mission in the world. When Jesus walked the earth, God worked through the physical body of Christ; today he uses his spiritual body. The church is God\'s instrument on earth.

As members of Christ\'s body, we are his hands, his feet, his eyes, and his heart. He works through us in the world. We each have a contribution to make.

Paul tells us, \"He creates each of us by Christ Jesus to join him in the work he does, the good work he has gotten ready for us to do, work we had better be doing.\" (Ephesians 2:10 MSG) (Rick Warren\'s Daily Devotional)","prayer": "Heavenly Father, thank you for the privilege of being called into the Body of Christ as a member.

None of us are immune to temptation. Given the right situation, you and I are capable of any sin. God knows this, so he has assigned us as individuals the responsibility of keeping each other on track.

The Bible says, \"Encourage one another daily so that none of you may be hardened by sin\'s deceitfulness.\" (Hebrews 3:13 NIV)

We are called and commanded to be involved in each other\'s lives. If you know someone who is wavering spiritually right now, it is your responsibility to go after that person and bring him/her back into the fellowship.

James tells us, \"If you know people who have wandered off from God\'s truth, don\'t write them off. Go after them. Get them back.\" (James 5:19 MSG)

A related benefit of a local church is that it also provides the spiritual protection of godly leaders. God gives the shepherd leader the responsibility to guard, protect, defend, and care for the spiritual welfare of his flock.

We are told, \"Their work is to watch over your souls, and they know they are accountable to God.\" (Hebrews 13:17 NLT)

Satan loves detached believers, unplugged from the life of the Body, isolated from God\'s family, and unaccountable to spiritual leaders -- because he knows they are defenseless and powerless against his tactics.

Conviction is really much more than that. Your convictions include your values, commitments, and motivations.

I like the definition of conviction I once heard from the great Bible teacher Howard Hendricks: \"A belief is something you will argue about. A conviction is something you will die for!\"

Our convictions determine our conduct. They motivate us to act in certain ways.

When you first become a Christian you often do things simply because other Christians around you suggest them or model them. You may pray, read the Bible and attend services because you see the examples of others.

This is fine for a new Christian. Little children learn the same way. However, as you grow, you must eventually develop your own reasons for doing what you do. Those reasons become convictions.

Biblical convictions are essential for spiritual growth and maturity. What is ironic today is that people often have strong convictions about weak issues (football, fashions, etc.) while having weak convictions about major issues (what is right and what is wrong).

Think about your walk with Jesus and make a list of the convictions you now hold. Are your convictions weak on any major issues? (Rick Warren\'s Daily Devotional)","prayer": "Heavenly Father, we pray for relatively stronger convictions when it comes to our values, commitments and faith (as believers in Jesus Christ) because we understand that it\'s these very convictions that will significantly and ultimately  determine our conduct. We have prayed in Jesus name. Amen","ts": 2013-05-04 18:40:17}, {"id": 616,"dt": "","pastor": 38,"theme": "Conviction Leads to Spiritual Growth","scripture": "Romans 12:2","reading": "\"Don\'t let the world squeeze you into its own mold, but let God remold your mind from within.\"","bible": "Phillips","devotion": "A person without conviction is at the mercy of circumstances. If you don\'t determine what\'s important and how you\'ll live, other people will determine it for you.

A person without conviction is a weak, jellyfish type of individual who mindlessly follows the crowd. I believe Paul was talking about conviction when he said in Romans 12:2, \"Don\'t let the world squeeze you into its own mold, but let God remold your mind from within .\" (Phillips)

Conviction helps us be diligent in continuing to grow spiritually. Growth requires time and effort. Without convictions about growth, people become discouraged and give up. No one stays with a difficult task unless he is convinced that there is a good reason for doing it. A church can teach people how to pray, how to study the Bible, and how to witness, but without imparting the corresponding convictions, people will not stick with it.

Knowing what to do (knowledge), why to do it (perspective) and how to do it (skill) is worthless if you don\'t have the conviction that will motivate you to actually do it!

The people who have made the greatest impact on this world, for good or evil, were the people with the strongest, deepest convictions. They weren\'t necessarily the smartest, wealthiest, or best educated people, but their convictions moved them to move the world. (Rick Warren\'s Daily Devotional)","prayer": "Heavenly Father, after learning how powerful convictions are, we make of us these convictions: Nothing will separate us from the love of Christ. We are more than conquerors. We are gods, children of the most high God. ... May you instill in us the deepest conviction of your Word and Truth in our spirits in Jesus Name we have prayed.

This produced a deep awareness of his life\'s purpose and kept him from being distracted by the agenda of others. If you want to gain insight into the convictions Jesus held, just study all the times he used the phrase \"I must.\"

When people develop Christlike convictions, they, too, develop a sense of purpose.

Conviction also has an attractive quality to it. This explains the popularity of many cults. Their beliefs are erroneous and often illogical, yet they are believed with intense conviction. In contrast, churches without clear, strong convictions will never attract the level of commitment that Christ deserves.

We must burn with the conviction that the Kingdom of God is the greatest cause in the world.

It was when you received the the life which Jesus died for you to have - \'the life of God\'. But, your mind did not get born-again when your Spirit became one with God (when your spirit was renewed)! Your mind was still the very same mind you always had! That is why a few days after you got born-again, you still had sinful thoughts (thoughts which go against God\'s Word), you still thought the same way as you had always thought.

Creation displays God’s “wondrous works” (Ps. 145:5). And when we stop to meditate on those works, we can’t help but be awed as our minds and spirits are moved to reflect onthe character of the God who created them.

And though as Christians we may not commemorate these holidays in the traditional biblical sense, as we discover the significance of each, we will certainly gain a greater knowledge of God\'s Word, an improved understanding of the Bible, and a deeper relationship with the Lord. About Pentecost: Throughout Jewish history, it has been customary to engage in all-night study of the Torah on the first evening of Shavuot. Children were encouraged to memorize Scripture and rewarded with treats. The book of Ruth was traditionally read during Shavuot. Today, however, many of the customs have been left behind and their significance lost. The public holiday has become more of a culinary festival of dairy dishes. Traditional Jews still light candles and recite blessings, adorn their homes and synagogues with greenery, eat dairy foods, study the Torah, read the book of Ruth and attend Shavuot services.
...The book of Acts continues to record the miraculous outpouring of the Holy Spirit that began on Pentecost. Once again we see the Old Testament revealing a shadow of the things to come through Christ! After Moses went up to Mount Sinai, the Word of God was given to the Israelites at Shavuot. When the Jews accepted the Torah, they became servants of God. Similarly, after Jesus went up to heaven, the Holy Spirit was given at Pentecost. When the disciples received the gift, they became witnesses for Christ. Jews celebrated a joyous harvest on Shavuot, and the church celebrated a harvest of newborn souls on Pentecost. •Shavuot is one of the three pilgrimage feasts when all Jewish males were required to appear before the Lord in Jerusalem. •Pentecost or Shavuot has many names in the Bible (the Feast of Weeks, the Feast of Harvest, and the Latter Firstfruits). •The days is celebrated on the fiftieth day after passover. In biblical times Shavuot also marked the beginning of the new agricultural season and meant that it is a Harvest Season. ...One can read more and follow up on these 3 Pilgrimage Festivals and the Day of Pentecost, especially, on About.com and some internet sites.","prayer": "Lord Jesus Christ, thank you for speaking with the Father on our behalf to send His Holy Spirit to abide and remain with us forevermore unto the day of salvation.

I am not belittling fasting, praying or speaking in tongues, but to be filled with all the fullness of God is not about what you do. It is not even about your love for Christ.

He gave sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and even raised the dead back to life. Many Jews had no idea that the Messiah, when He came, would do such things - but the scriptures had clearly foretold that He would (Isaiah 29:18; 35:5-6; 42:7). When John the baptist began questioning whether Jesus was the promised Messiah, Jesus sent this message back with John\'s disciples: \"Go and tell John the things which you hear and see: the blind see and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up\" (Matthew 11:4-5 NKJV). Jesus fully expected that John would understand that these miracles were proof that He was the Messiah. These things (miracles) were part of Jesus\' ministry for two reasons: First, they proved that God had given power to Jesus. When Jesus healed a blind man, His religious enemies cross-examined the man, insisting that Jesus was a sinful, godless person. The formerly blind man wisely replied, \"Since the world began it was not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing\" (John 9:32-33 KJV). Jesus\' astonishing miracles were proof that He was the Messiah. From the beginning of Jesus\' ministry, \"many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did\" (John 2:23 KJV). The second reason that Jesus did healing miracles was that He cared for people. In a day when so many were sick and doctors so few and their skills so limited, healing power clearly demonstrated God\'s love for them.","prayer": "Dear Jesus, thank you for your love which you have revealed unto us all!","ts": 2013-05-28 06:40:40}, {"id": 653,"dt": "","pastor": 226,"theme": "Seek The Expansion of God\'s Kingdom","scripture": "Matthew 6:33","reading": "But seek ye first the kingdom of God,and his righteousness;and all these things shall be added unto you","bible": "King James Version","devotion": "Nothing ought to be more important to you as a child of God than getting involved in soul winning and Kingdom expansion.Matthew 6:33 enjoins that you seek first the Kingdom of God,and its expansion,and everything else will be added unto you.Now is time brothers and sisters,to commit ourself to soul winning more than ever before.The time is short,and the Lord is counting on you.This is the day of salvation;the season of the end-time harvest.As God\'s people we ought to recognoze that the responsibility of telling others about the Gospel of Christ\'s salvation has been entrusted to us(2 corinthians5:18),and we must do the work of Him that sent us while it is day.True success comes when  we understand God\'s vision and align yourself with it.God\'s vision is that the knowledge of his Word fills the earth as the water cover the sea.He has made us ministers and witnesses of the Gospel.","prayer": "Dear Lord,i thank u for entrusted us,thank u to know dat the responsibility of telling other about the Gospel of ur son is in us.Father we thank u and we bless u,in Jesus Name.Amen","ts": 2013-05-28 08:35:23}, {"id": 654,"dt": "","pastor": 412,"theme": "Complete surrender","scripture": "1 Corinthians 6:19","reading": "Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you,whom you have from God, and you are not your own","bible": "The Gideons International","devotion": "This scripture clearly simply says that \"we do not belong to ourselves\".

Do not behave as the Pharisees who wear the broadest phylacteries and the longest fringes and want the front seats in synagogues and love to be greeted obsequiously in market squares, and want to be called “Rabbis” by the people. One alone is your Master: the Christ. You who in future will be the new doctors, I am referring to you, My apostles and disciples, remember that I alone am your Teacher. And I will be your only Teacher also when I am no longer among you. Because Wisdom alone teaches. So do not allow yourselves to be called teachers, because you are disciples yourselves. Do not pretend to be called fathers and do not call father anyone on the Earth, because only one is the Father of all men: your Father Who is in Heaven. May this truth make you wise by really feeling all like brothers to one another, both those who guide and those who are guided, and so love one another like good brothers. And none of those who guide must allow themselves to be called guides, because only one is your guide: the Christ.

Let the greatest among you be your servant. He who is the servant of the servants of God does not humiliate himself, but he imitates Me, as I was kind and humble, always willing to love those who were My brothers in the flesh of Adam, and to assist them by means of the power that I have as God. Neither by serving men did I humiliate what is divine in Me. Because he is a true king who knows how to dominate not so much men, as the passions of men, first of all foolish pride. Remember: he who humbles himself will be exalted, and he who exalts himself will be humbled.”

This activity happens on a number of levels. When a person who’s trying hard to lose weight consistently binges on pizza and ice cream, disappointment ensues. When an individual commits a crime, victims suffer and the perpetrator risks jail time. When a husband or wife chooses to engage in an extramarital affair, the marriage is damaged—sometimes beyond repair—and children suffer the consequences. When a CEO decides to overlook or sometimes even encourage accounting inconsistencies, giant corporations fail, high-level indictments follow and investors lose their savings.

What do all of the scenarios outlined above have in common? Every one of these accounts, as well as countless other failure-filled stories, can trace its origin to the book of Genesis. Today’s reading gives us a glimpse of the first failure to follow a direct command from God and the devastating results of that failure. We see the repercussions of this disobedience reflected in the daily news—and, if we’re honest, reflected in our own darkened hearts.

At first, Adam and Eve were sure of God’s instructions. There was no doubt. They knew exactly what God wanted because they received their marching orders straight from the Creator himself. Still, a simple challenge (“Did God really say …?”) from the serpent shook Eve’s confidence to the core. Once she questioned what she knew to be true, she became vulnerable to Satan’s temptation. When she and Adam then acted in violation of God’s direct command, sin invaded what had been an unimaginably perfect paradise.

Spiritually speaking, what are you sure of beyond the shadow of a doubt? What do you know to be true? Where does your certainty come from? These are important questions to answer because you face tests every day that can undermine your Biblical marching orders. People may question your mental capacity: “How can an educated person believe in intelligent design when there’s so much evidence to support evolution?” Others may accuse you of being narrow-minded: “How can you say Jesus is the only way to God?” Some may appeal to your sense of freedom: “Doesn’t God want you to have any fun?” Still others might attack the source of your trust: “The Bible is full of inconsistencies, and you’re choosing to base your life on this book?”

I firmly believe the reason why many Christians do not experience victory is because they lack an important foundational key to success—prayer. Contrary to common religious beliefs, prayer is not pleading with God or bargaining with Him to act on our behalf. Neither is it characterized by a lot of “spiritual” sounding clichés that do not line up with the Word. Prayer is simply communicating with God by speaking His Word to Him in faith. When we pray this way, results are inevitable. 

Hebrews 4:12 clearly describes the power of that Word. It says, “For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” Verse 14 encourages believers to “hold fast to our profession.” In other words, speak God’s Word, because it is power-packed! When we pray, believing that we have already received what we are praying, God has no choice but to make our prayers come to pass. He honors His Word, not our emotions. 

Prayer should produce rest, or peace of mind. Many people pray fear-based prayers and hope they are getting through to God, but they really don’t have confidence in what they are praying. The Bible says that when we believe the Word, we will enter into a state of rest. The integrity of the Word speaks for itself, and will never fail. By allowing the Word to be the foundation of our prayer life, our confidence in our prayers will soar to new heights. We must know in our “knower” that Scripture is infallible, and have no doubt that what God says is true and that we already possess it. I urge you to begin to pray the solution to your problems first, rather than bombard heaven with desperate pleas. 

Prayer is the language through which you and the Father fellowship with one another. It is through your dialogue with Him that your faith to believe His promises through Jesus Christ will come to pass. As you spend time with Him in prayer, you will begin to recognize His voice more clearly. He desires to direct you at every turn, and a developed prayer life will make it easier for Him to guide you. 

Every failure in life is a prayer failure. God has already done everything He is going to do; the work has already been completed. Our job is to pray faith-filled prayers that are based on His Word and expect to receive results. Make no mistake about it; prayer is absolutely essential to our walking in the manifestation of God’s promises. It is a key to getting results as a Christian. Our prayers are heard. When we make the Word of God the foundation of our prayer life, we are guaranteed victory. We must not allow religion or tradition to blind us to the truth of what prayer really is. Your future depends on it !

Facing a battle as a Christian is that we overcome fear. Fear has torment; fear is the opposite of faith. When we find ourselves in the struggles of life, we don’t give in to fear, God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of love, power and a sound mind. Don’t be discouraged, don’t get over-whelmed by life. Another thing that happens in battles is weariness. People get tired; they feel like giving up or giving in. Don’t get discouraged, don’t give up. Depression is a pressing down of emotions, in the battle let God’s Spirit lift you up. God allows the battles to come into our lives so that He might reveal His power to us. Our battles aren’t our battles at all. We must learn to release them to God; we must learn to lay things down on the altar.


The battle is the Lord’s—God doesn’t ever put us into the midst of a battle to prove our strength and power, but to reveal His. This is where faith and trust come in, we trust God, and we put our faith in His Word. Many times we try to solve all our problems, try to fix things that seemingly won’t get fixed, and spend our time and energy running out to meet every giant in our lives. God says, stand still, wait on the Lord, trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not on thy own understanding. Standing still is the hardest thing to do.

God says, nothing is hard for Me, nothing is difficult for Me, nothing is impossible for Me. For the Lord will be with you—in our battles we are never alone, we aren’t facing battles by ourselves. God is with us, He will never leave you, nor forsake you, He will go with you to the ends of the earth. Many times our battle will seem so big that we can’t see anything except the battle. But God is with us, He is God of the mountain, but God of the valley. It is in the darkest times that He reveals His brightest lights. Facing the battle, we go into the battle with praise. We worship the Lord before the battle, we worship the Lord in the battle, and we worship the Lord after the victory. Battles come to steal our faith; battles come to rob us of our joy. The joy of the Lord is our strength.

Today, many of us are in struggles, battles, and many may feel hopeless or overwhelmed in the battle. Give the battle to the Lord, lay it on the altar and worship the Lord in the midst of the battle. Let faith overcome fear, and stand still and see the glory of the Lord. When I get into a struggle in life, and feel like I am in a battle that is too big for God, He reminds me that He took Israel, a million strong, delivered them, feed them and brought them into the promise land. If He can take care of millions, He surely can take care of you. Jesus said, do not worry or fret, if God can take care of this entire world, then surely He can take care of you.
Amen !

What channels does God use? The primary way that God speaks is through the Bible. This is why we need to read the Bible every day. God\'s will is found in God\'s Word.

God also speaks through godly Bible teachers. Have you ever been in church or at a Bible study and you feel like the teacher is speaking directly to you? In that moment, God is speaking directly to you.

God also speaks through other Christians. He even speaks through you. If you\'ll stay in tune to him and learn his Word, sometimes God will use you to say things to people that he wants to say to them. It\'s not something special reserved only for pastors; God speaks through every believer at different times.

You don’t depend once and then you’re done. It’s not, “Oh, I went to church on Sunday. I spent a couple hours. I did my duty.” No, if you’re going to depend on God, then all through the day your attitude should be, “God, I need You. God, help me to understand this subject in school. God, help me to raise these children.” That’s what it means to depend on God. The more you depend on God, the better things will work out. You will bear much fruit.

We can take the opposite of what Jesus said. If we don’t depend on Him, we’re not going to bear much fruit. We’re not going to be as productive as we could have been. Today, choose to abide in Him.

When you humble yourself and admit that you cannot do it on your own, that’s when God can enter the scene. That’s when He can turn it around. A lot of times we think of dependency in a negative light, but dependency on God is not a weakness; it’s a strength. It enables you to tap into His power. When we yield our weakness, that’s when God shows up the strongest. But when we don’t turn to God, really, that’s a sign of pride. We’re saying, “God, I don’t really need You to help me run my life.

The things you wish were most removed from your life are often the very things that God is using to shape you and make you into the believer of character He wants you to be. He wants to use that problem for good in your life. There\'s something more important than your pain. It\'s what you\'re learning from that pain. God is in control.

So what\'s the key? What\'s our response? Our response is to look past the pain. \"This is the reason we never lose heart. These troubles which are temporary are winning for us a permanent, a glorious and solid reward out of proportion to our pain. So we don\'t look at the temporary situation. We look beyond to see the eternal benefits.\" (2 Corinthians 4:16-17 Phillips) (Rick Warren\'s Daily Devotional)","prayer": "Dear heavenly Father, these present sufferings and pains, Paul says, \"they\'re temporary and but for a moment, preparing for us a permanent glory\".

You\'re not fooling God when you keep your sins hidden. He\'s not shocked by your sin and not surprised when you admit it to Him. Confessing you sin will never change the way He feels about you!

He knows your feelings and frustrations. He\'s seen the crisis in your soul. There\'s no hurt that goes unnoticed by God. Psalm 56:6 says, \"You know how troubled I am; you have kept a record of my tears.\" (Good News)

Often when we\'re hurting, we feel very isolated and lonely. Maybe there\'s been a death in the family, a divorce, maybe we\'ve gotten fired, and we start to think, \"Nobody understands the way I feel; nobody can tell the way I feel; nobody feels the pain.\"

But God knows, and \"The LORD is like a father to his children, tender and compassionate to those who fear him.\" (Psalms 103:13 NLT)

God not only sees, He cares!

He knows the causes, the reasons, the things that brought you to this point. He understands because he made you, and he sees the hurt in your heart like nobody else can.

Because God knows our frustrations and despair, we can give those feelings to God: \"Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about what happens to you.\" (1 Peter 5:7 NLT) Cast them all permanently on God, once and for all, and then, don\'t take them back.

         He did this for Ruth. She trusted God for favor when she went looking for a field in which to glean.

(Ruth 2:3) Of all the fields in Bethlehem, she happened to end up inBoazs field, and he was a close relative of Elimelech, her father-in-law. This meant that Boaz was her potential kinsman redeemer, someone who could redeem her from her plight as a young, childless widow in a foreign land.
         Boaz also happened to be a man of great wealth (Ruth 2:1), and as it turned out, he was willing to redeem Ruth. (Ruth 4:910) All these right happenings could only mean that God had placed Ruth in the right place at the right time.
         I believe that the very day Ruth told her mother-in-law that the Godof Israel would be her God (Ruth 1:16), God took note of it and made everything happen right for her.
         Today, God also wants you to know that because you have said, God, You are My God, He will be your God of divine happenings. He will place you at the right place at the right time, where you will meet the right people, do the right things and even escape danger!

But they\'re going to the wrong source because the only one who knows what\'s going to happen next is God.

The Bible says He\'s able to be in the past, the present, and the future all at the same time. That should give us great confidence in God. He not only knows about the future, He\'s there in the future. He not only walks with us day-by-day, He can also walk in our future.

If I know that God knows all my tomorrows - today -- then I should ask for advice. The things you don\'t know, God can tell you about. He\'s not going to lay out your whole life all at once, telling you everything that will happen in your life. If He did, you\'d likely get very discouraged or prideful or both.

And then we act as if God is unaware of our bills? \"Don\'t you see, God? I\'m going under! I\'m not going to make it!\" We\'re trying to stretch and make ends meet. We get uptight, upset, and we worry. But worry is the result of not realizing the omniscience of God.

When we think that God doesn\'t know what\'s going on in our lives, we think we have to take matters into our own hands. In effect, we\'re saying, \"I\'ll be God.\" Worrying is taking responsibility for things God never intended you to have.

The truth is God is aware of all your needs. He\'s aware of every single need you have: financial needs, spiritual needs, sexual needs, social needs, and emotional needs. In fact, the Bible says God knows what you need before you ask. Prayer is never giving information to God. He already knows what\'s going on in your life.

But, one thing we have to learn is that God honors perseverance. On the way to your “yes” you may encounter some “no’s.” You may encounter some closed doors, but that doesn’t mean it’s the final answer. It just means “keep going.”
Remember, if God promised it, He’s going to bring it to pass. Scripture tells us that through faith and patience we inherit God’s promises. This is where patience comes in; this is where perseverance comes in. This is where trust comes in. Just because you don’t see things happen right away doesn’t mean you should quit.

God has done all this, so that we will look for him and reach out and find him.

Much of the world already thinks globally. The largest media and business conglomerates are all multi-national. Our lives are increasingly intertwined with those in other nations as we share fashions, entertainment, music, sports, and even fast foods. Probably most of the clothes you\'re wearing, and much of what you eat today was produced in another country.

We\'re more connected than we realize and God can use that connectedness as a means for us to fulfill his Great Commission. Jesus gave us a pattern for such involvement: \" You will tell everyone about me in Jerusalem, in all Judea, in Samaria, and everywhere in the world.\" (Acts 1:8 CEV)

His followers are to reach out to their community (Jerusalem), to their country (Judea), to other cultures (Samaria) and to other nations (everywhere in the world). Note that our commission is simultaneous, not sequential. We are called to be on mission to all four groups in some way.

He was saying in effect, “There is a yes from God in our future!”
Elijah told his assistant to go look on the other side of the mountain to see if there was any sign of rain. When the assistant came back, he said, “No, Elijah. There’s not a cloud in the sky. It’s perfectly clear.” Elijah didn’t get discouraged and think, “What are we going to do now? I might as well quit this prophet business.” No, he simply said, “Go back and look again.”
This happened six different times, but Elijah kept saying, “Go look again.” On the seventh time, the servant came back and said, “Elijah, I saw a small cloud in the sky. It isn’t much, just the size of a man’s hand.” Elijah’s answer was basically, “You’d better get your umbrella. Rain is coming!”
Friend, like Elijah, maybe you are believing for something and aren’t seeing anything happen. Don’t give up, go look again! If God has promised it, He will do it.

Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in the lust thereof.

16-18 Know ye not,that to whom ye yield yourself servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey;whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? 
But God be thanked, that you were the servant of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.
being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.","bible": "KJV","devotion": "There is no more important element than to understand how to yield.  The Lordship of Christ is central to all we do in His name. But what is it and how is it done?  
The Bible teaches that at the moment we are converted we are \"indwelt\" by the Holy Spirit.  He takes up residence in us, never to leave. If you are a christian, then you have all of the Holy Spirit you will ever have or need. He is present in you , fully present. But having all of the Holy Spirit is not the same as the Holy Spirit having all of you!It is here at this point that \"yielding\" is important.
The New Testament calls this yielding.
The New Testament calls this yielding process being \"filled with the Holy Spirit.\"
Ephesians:5:18 gives us the command to be filled along with an apt analogy., it says and be not drunk with wine,wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit. When one is filled with wine (drunk), it does not mean that the person is filled like a container.  Rather, it means that he or she is under the control of the wine.  It affects how one walks, talks, speaks and thinks.  So, too is one who is filled with the Holy Spirit.  It does not mean that we are filled as a container; we already have all of Him that is available.  Rather, to be filled means we are controlled by Him. Thus if we put ourselves under His control (yield to Him,in other words), He will produce some effects: He will walk, talk, speak and think and much more too!","prayer": "Father God today may we yield to the Holy Spirit and allow Him to control the way we walk, talk and speak, as we live daily and sacrifice self daily may our focus be on what it is we are called to do in this chaotic world.

One way to develop global thinking is to read and watch the news with \"Great Commission Eyes.\' Wherever there is change or conflict, you can be sure that God will use it to bring people to him. People are most receptive to God when they are under tension or in transition. Because the rate of change is increasing in our world, more people are open to hearing the good news now than ever before.

As God told Habakkuk, \"Look around at the nations; look and be amazed! For I am doing something in your own day, something you wouldn\'t believe even if someone told you about it.\" (Habakkuk 1:5 NLT)

Prayer is the most important tool for your mission in the world. People may refuse our love, or reject our message, but they are defenseless against our prayers. You can aim a prayer at a person\'s heart whether you\'re ten feet or 10,000 miles away.

What should you pray for? The Bible tells us to pray for opportunities to witness, for courage to speak up, for those who will believe, for the rapid spread of the message, and for more workers. Prayer helps us do what God calls us to do, and it makes you a partner with others around the world.

You should also pray for missionaries and everyone else involved in the global harvest. Paul told his prayer partners, \"You are also joining to help us when you pray for us.\" (2 Corinthians 1:11) (Rick Warren\'s Daily Devotional)","prayer": "Heavenly Father, we pray for opportunities to witness, for courage to speak up, for those who will believe, for the rapid spread of the message, and for more workers in the Name of Jesus Christ.

And don\'t be afraid of the people, for I will be with you and take care of you.\" (Jeremiah 1:7-8 NLT)

Maybe you\'ve believed that you needed a special \"call\" from God, and you\'ve been waiting for some supernatural feeling or experience, but God has already stated his call repeatedly. God doesn\'t want to use just some of his people; he wants to use all of his people. We\'re all called to be on mission for God. He wants his whole church to take the whole gospel to the whole world.

If you want to be like Jesus, you must care about what he cares about most and you must have a heart for the whole world! You can\'t be satisfied with just your family and friends coming to Christ. There are over six billion people on earth, and Jesus wants all his lost children found.

The Great Commission is your commission, and doing your part is the secret to living a life of significance.

For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.It is upon us we Christians to either believe that God is powerful and He is caring for us or believe that nothing good is coming upon our way.
Fear and faith has something in common,they both tell us to believe that something gonna happen. Fear tells you that whatever you are going through everyone has gone through it and none of them came out in victory, while Faith tells you that whatever you are going through is nothing compared to the greatness that is ahead and it is just for a moment and everything will be fine.Fear says you\'ve been through so much and you\'ll never be happy, while faith says that don\'t worry, your best days are coming.
What you meditate on is what will definitely come to happen. Read Job 3:25, Job says that, For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
Don\'t use your energy to worry but instead use it to believe.
Quit expecting worse and start expecting God\'s favor. Fear, worry, negativity is also contagious, if people around you are always worried and afraid, you will definitely be like them.
When you are with them, don\'t get into what they talk so much, and after parting ways you need to take heavy dozes of faith.
Don.t ever give up on your dreams because someone else said bad about it, keep pressing on and hold on faith. When you feel like giving up on something, that\'s the time you should push yourself to doing it.Fear is like a fog that will; pass away and if you have faith you will move mountains in your life.","prayer": "Father in the mighty Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, thank you for the favor upon me.You said that favor will last for a life time and that goodness and mercies shall follow me all the days of my life.

We needed God to pardon us and remove the death sentence. Our spirits needed to be given life. And God did this. \"You...He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses\" (Colossians 2:13 NKJV). Jesus said, \"That which is born of flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit\" (John 3:6 KJV).

1 Timothy 4:8 says: \"Take the time and trouble to keep yourself spiritually fit.\" (Phillips) How do you stay spiritually fit so you can love people? By building spiritually refreshing habits into your life.

A Daily Quiet Time - \"This is the reason we never lose heart.

A Small Group--A Christian without a small group is an orphan. You need a small group. The Bible says, \"Let us encourage one another.\" (Hebrews 11:25) You need to get together in a small group at least weekly where you can share needs and problems, where you care for one another.

Worship--Praising God will renew and rejuvenate you. Psalms 59 says, \"I will sing of your strength in the morning and I will sing of your love for you are my refuge in times of trouble.\" You need that emotional release and that recharging that comes from singing.

Remembering your past failures -- Remembering your past failures is like putting a movie in your mind of all your mistakes and playing it over and over. It tortures you to death and it causes you to doubt your abilities.

God does not want you focusing on your past. If you stay focused on your past mistakes, you can\'t get on with your present. And God can\'t use you in the future. God says forget the past.

But, one thing we have to learn is that God honors perseverance. On the way to your “yes” you may encounter some “no’s.” You may encounter some closed doors, but that doesn’t mean it’s the final answer. It just means “keep going.”
Remember, if God promised it, He’s going to bring it to pass. Scripture tells us that through faith and patience we inherit God’s promises. This is where patience comes in; this is where perseverance comes in. This is where trust comes in. Just because you don’t see things happen right away doesn’t mean you should quit.

The point is this: Every miracle begins with a problem. If you don\'t have a problem, you don\'t need a miracle.

Do you have a problem? If you do, then have I got good news for you! You\'re a candidate for a miracle. The starting point is to recognize there is a problem.

Like the disciples, there are three common reactions that people have toward problems.

We procrastinate -- \"By this time it was late in the day.\" (verse 35) The disciples put off the problem until the end of the day. They did nothing and Jesus waited on them.

We pass the buck -- \"Send the people away.\" (verse 36) Basically the disciples were saying, \"It\'s not our problem. If they\'re hungry, let them go find their own food.\"

We worry about it -- \"Lord, if we did that it\'d cost eight months of a man\'s wages. Are we going to go spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?\" (verse 38) The disciples\' anxiety went into overdrive and they started worrying.

The Apostle John, in his account of the feeding of the 5,000, tells us that the hero of the story is a little boy. (John 6:9)

There are three things to note about this little boy.

He gave what he had - The boy didn\'t have much, but he gave what he had. Never underestimate what God can do through ordinary people and limited resources given to him in faith. If you want to be used by God just get available.

He gave God all he had - The boy gave all five loaves and both fish. He didn\'t hold anything back from God. If you want a miracle in your life, you cannot hold anything back from God.

He gave it immediately when it was asked for - The boy didn\'t hesitate. As soon as Jesus needed it, the boy gave it to Him (and I am not talking about money here, money can be one of the things you can give).

Why don\'t we give like that (that boy) when we need a miracle? Either we don\'t believe that God will take care of our needs if we give sacrificially to him or we think, \"What\'s the use? How could my little bit help?\"

The important thing is to be willing to give as much as we can. That is what God accepts. God is a massive giver. (Rick Warren\'s Daily Devotional)","prayer": "Dear heavenly Father, I know and understand that You are a big Giver, You gave us Jesus and the Holy Spirit (and all of Yourself).

If you ever use that word \"impossible,\" listen for a laugh from heaven! It\'s not in His vocabulary. \"With God all things are possible.\" (Matthew 19:26 NIV) That\'s a pretty all-inclusive statement. No matter how big your problem is, God can handle it. But you must do your part. Do what you can with what you have and then expect God to take it from there.

The feeding of the 5,000 teaches a principle that\'s all through the Scripture: you cannot out-give God. Whenever you give something to Him in faith, the blessing is incredible. \"And the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. And the number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.\" (Mark 6:43-44 NIV)

A slave knows that the more he pleases his master, it is the more closer he gets to the master\'s heart. A slave knows that the more he makes his master happy, it is the more his name becomes beautiful in the master\'s list of favourites. We are slaves of righteousness. In the book of 2 Cor 5:21, the bible is so much clear that Jesus was made sin that we could become the righteousness of God. YES, we are the righteousness of God in Christ. We fully function within the borders of righteousness. We fully posses the righteousness of God. Doing good is not something we struggle for, it happens automatically. Doing right is not a burden unto us, it is something we delight in, because we are the righteousness of God. Sometimes we are kind and loving to others, without even being aware!

You might ask, save us from what? He is there on high to save us from falling into sin. it is a practical salvation from spiritual dangers in the path. This shows that He is greatly concerned about us, and He doesn\'t want to see us fall into sin and spoil our life and testimony. Not only that He also sympathizes with our infirmities (sickness). Everything that we may be going through as far as afflictions are concerned, whether they are emotional or physical,He feels it and sympathizes with us. 
In these great provisions of God we have our responsible part, our part is that we must \"come unto God by Him.\" This speaks of expressing our dependence on the Lord for His help daily. It is closely connected with the provision of prayer, but here it is more about expressing our dependence on Him for every step in the path of faith,than making specific prayer requests.

What a blessing the gift of Christ is to each of us. Without His sacrifice we would not have a personal relationship with God. When you begin counting your blessings, the gift if Christ coming to earth will undoubtedly be at the top because it changed everything in this world. The possibility of a relationship with God, all it offers, and the promise of heaven are all available because of the blessing of Christ coming to earth. That\'s the number one blessing - the gift of Christ!","prayer": "Dear Father, yes, that\'s what I want. I want to be more and more like Christ in my thoughts, words and actions.

They do as little as they can to get by, always looking for the easy way out. If the boss isn’t watching, they’re playing on the computer. They simply go to work to pick up a paycheck, then wonder why they’re not promoted and don’t see increase. It’s because God doesn’t bless mediocrity; He blesses excellence. 
Whatever we do, we should do it to the best of our ability and set the standard. Remember, you are ultimately working for the Lord. He’s the one who put those talents and abilities in you. You are a steward of the gifts He’s given. Other people may show up late. They may complain. They may cut corners. But don’t sink down to their level — you are working for Almighty God. You are called to excellence! 
I encourage you today, stay determined. Stay focused. Whether you’re a waitress, a truck driver, an architect, a police officer or a CEO, do it to the best of your ability. God is the one who brings promotion. When you set the standard, He will raise you up and pour out His blessing all the days of your life.","prayer": "Father in heaven, today I choose a path of excellence.

Confidence in love gives you freedom to be yourself. You trust the person who loves you to sift through the garbage of your moods or self-centeredness, and just keep on loving you - as you do for him or her. The one who loves you desires to help and encourage you to be the best person you can be and helps you realize your potential. Knowing you are loved is like living inside a high, protective security fence and at the same time having complete and total freedom. Love brings happiness, joy, security and fulfillment. Of course, the ultimate love experience is with God. We love because He first loved us. It all began there. God\'s love for you is full and complete. It is unconditional and beyond understanding. God\'s love surrounds you and lifts you up from your own weak self-image and disappointments. Love, both human and divine is the ultimate blessing.","prayer": "Dear Father, love gives me the greatest joy. I feel so secure and comfortable in the love of my family and friends.

In Haggai it says, “The people said, ‘The time has not yet come to rebuild the Lord’s house,’ even though Cyrus had ordered it eighteen years earlier.” 
Notice that through Cyrus, God had told them to rebuild eighteen years before, but they were still saying, “It’s not the right time. Let’s do it later.” I can imagine that in the first year they thought, “Let’s not do it now. We’re busy.” Second year, “It’s not convenient. Let’s do it some other time.” Eighteen years later, they were still putting it off. 
What happens when we don’t do what God is asking us to do? Verse six says, “You have sown much but reaped little. You’ve earned your wages, but you’re putting them in a bag with holes in it.” Verse seven says, “Consider your ways.” Friend, don’t try to fill a bag that has holes in it. You won’t be able to get ahead. You won’t be effective. What’s the answer? Consider your ways. Be quick to obey. Don’t wait to pursue that dream. Don’t wait to forgive. Don’t wait to get serious about your relationship with God. Do it today and partake of all the blessings He has in store for you!","prayer": "Father, today I choose to be quick to obey. I don’t want to waste time. I don’t want to try to fill a bag with holes in it.
